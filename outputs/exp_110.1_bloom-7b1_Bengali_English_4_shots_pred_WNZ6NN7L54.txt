Over time, the new population adapts to their new environment, and their similarity to other populations decreases.

Actually the 35mm format is somewhat confusing as it is 24mm in length but 36mm in width.
Therefore, the approximate ratio (12 divided by the simple whole number ratio) is 3:2.
Common formats (for example, APS family formats) are similar to or equal to the aspect ratio.

In Savanna, the ability to digest plants is a prerequisite for the survival of herbivorous primates.
Despite all the efforts, it is failing to reduce the burden of mental health problems and malnutrition.
Accessible plant protein sources such as leaves and pods are easy to digest, but they are not suitable for cooking as they are not suitable for primates.
Comparatively, animal food (pupa, fly, egg) is easily digested and provides high amounts of protein which contains all essential amino acids.
However, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their protein problems in the same way as the Sivanas do today.
Sleep disruption is a conscious process of remaining awake for a short period of time (10-60 minutes) and then falling asleep.

Scientific research aims to determine how the world works by applying scientific methods. This is the direction of scientific research.
Only this is not enough, but also experimentation is a method that can be used to exclude one or more possible hypotheses, to ask questions, and to observe, and also to guide scientific research.
Philosophers and naturalists focused on classical texts and especially on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's view was that all sciences were included in the category of philosophy.
Refusing to acknowledge knowledge of Greek philosophy and science, the West began to feel itself disconnected from the roots of Greek philosophy and science.
Physiology and behavior of many rhythms are closely monitored and often depend on biological clocks.
Sequence of events, which is not only a response but also a record of external periodic signals, has been documented in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks have their own self-sustained oscillators that can run for long periods of time without external input, even when cycling without any external input.
DNA is one of the most important genetic components, which was first demonstrated by Hershey and Chase.
Harsh and Chaj used their own DNA to insert it into a bacterium.
They identified the DNA of the stage through a radioactive phosphorus or the protein through a radioactive sulfur.

Recent scientific evidence suggests that the huge carbon-based economy has disrupted the stability of the biosphere which has been suitable for human evolution for the past 2 million years.
Everyone lives in society and uses transportation systems. Many people complain about transportation systems.
These kinds of allegations are very rare in developed countries.
Why do transport systems raise these complaints, why do they fail daily? What engineering skills are required to be a good transport engineer?
The flow of traffic between two points is called traffic flow.
However, it is difficult to predict the driving behaviour of drivers because their driving skills are never 100 percent sure.
However, drivers tend to follow a certain sequence of speeds and this allows the transportation system to be presented in a mathematically tractable way.
Flow, Density and Velocity are the three main features of traffic flow.
These relationships help in planning, designing and managing road and transport infrastructure.
Insects are the first organisms to fly. Their flight ability helps them avoid their enemies and find food and companions more easily.

These models are built using a large amount of data and materials that help us understand the mind processes.
Despite the strong literary intent of AI, AI is a very important sub-field of computer science which studies the behaviour, learning, and adaptation of machines.
Artificial intelligence research includes the development of intelligent machines that can perform tasks that require intelligent behavior.
These include control, planning and scheduling, customer requirements and answers, handwriting, voice and face recognition.
