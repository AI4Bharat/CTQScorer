It confirms not only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already very widely accepted, but provides details that fossils cannot usually provide, such as the colour and the three-dimensional arrangement of feathers.
Scientists say that this bird's feathers were brown-tan on top and pale or carotened on the bottom.
This discovery also allows us to better understand the evolution of feathers in birds.
But because dinosaur feathers do not have a fully developed root, but show other characteristics that are typical of feathers – feathers and feather-like tufts – the researchers have concluded that the root was probably an evolutionary development later on.
The plumage structure suggests that the feathers were not used for flight but rather for temperature regulation or display.
The scientists say that this is certainly the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, but the sample reveals a feather belonging to an adult, and not to a juvenile.

His other event, the giant slalom, enabled him to finish tenth in the women's sitting group with a combined time of 4:41.30, that is 2:11.60 minutes slower than the Austrian Claudia Loesch, who won, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani, who finished ninth
In the category of women sitting skiers, four skiers have not made it to the finish line; in the slalom, 45 skiers on a total of 117 skiers in this race have not made it to the finish line. 
The police of Madhya Pradesh found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
The assistant inspector general D. K. Arya said: "We have arrested five people for violating the Swiss citizen, and we have recovered her mobile phone and laptop.
The accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the police commissioner, said that the people accused had their faces covered when they appeared before the court.
While three people were present in the house when the car hit it, no one was injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The road where the accident took place was temporarily closed to allow rescue teams to extract the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was first taken to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to the Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son by the Sheriff Court of Edinburgh.
She is in custody awaiting trial, but eyewitness testimony could be compromised because her picture has been widely disseminated.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but the Scottish courts operate differently and have considered that publishing photos was potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, of Dundee University, notes that "journalists seem to be following a dangerous line if they publish photographs, etc. of suspects.
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is responsible for all prosecutions, has explained to journalists that no further comment will be made at least until the prosecution.
According to the leak, the document will deal with the dispute at the border that the Palestinians claim on the basis of the existing borders before the Middle East war of 1967.
The other topics discussed included the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel requires a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of ten years from the signing of an agreement, whereas the Palestinian Authority is prepared to grant a five-year term.
The shooters of the supplementary parasite control trial were closely monitored by rangers, because the trial was controlled and its efficacy assessed.
In the context of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) inc., qualified volunteers have been recruited, in the context of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, temporary conservation manager for the NPWS, the four shooters named for the first slaughtering campaign were properly trained and instructed on safety procedures.
Martelly has intronized yesterday a new provisional Electoral Council (CEP) made up of nine members. 
It is the fifth PEC of Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the dissolution of the previous CEP in the context of a package of measures aimed at engaging the country on a new path towards elections.
This Commission was the response of Martelly to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The protests sometimes violent were triggered by the absence of elections, some of which were due to take place in 2011.
About 60 iPods overheating cases have been reported, resulting in six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been informed of 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, the METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which it has described as "minor".
The Ministry of Health has reacted by calling it'really regrettable' that Apple has postponed the report.
The earthquake struck the Mariannes at 7:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The Office of Emergency Management for the Northern Mariana Islands said there had been no damage reported in this country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has said there is no sign of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer took hostage tourists from Hong Kong in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at tourists.
At least six hostages have been saved, and the death of at least six of them has been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released prematurely, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and became a doctor.
He has followed a training course in obstetrics and started working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When he was working at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature births during his free time. 
His research has shown that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the pulmonary maturation of the baby.
The Xinhua news agency reported that the government investigators recovered two flight recorders (or 'black boxes') on Wednesday.
Other fighters also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: 'Luna was the first Queen of the extreme. My first manager. Luna was dead at two moons. A unique moment, just like she. A strong woman.'
Dustin 'Goldust' Runnels commented that 'Luna was as strange as me... or even more... I love her and I'll miss her... I hope she rests in a better place.'
A survey conducted among 1 400 people before the federal elections in 2010 revealed that the number of opponents to the transformation of Australia into a republic had increased by 8 % since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the federal election campaign that she thought Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 per cent of those interviewed share this view, and wish that Queen Elizabeth II is the last monarch to rule Australia.
At the extremes, 29 % of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 % believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was required to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical condition was questioned.
He could not take the necessary medications to overcome his pain, these being banned within the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer scientist at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25, 2008.
Many people have checked the discovery using different equipment and software in February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water for the earth, as well as organic matter that can form proteins and promote life.
The scientists hope to understand how planets form, and particularly how the Earth formed, because comets have collided with it for a long time.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, 53, began his term in office in January and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He has described the rumours as 'political chatter and foolishness'.
We think he will run for the presidency in 2016.
According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that would allow aircraft to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, reducing carbon emissions.
It is based on satellite technology, and not on ground-based radar systems used previously, which enables air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more detailed information.
The additional transport is non-existent and the surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and the parking and relay sites are not available on the ground.
The fear of not having enough transport has led to the possibility that the match could be played behind closed doors, without the supporters of the teams.
A study published today in Science reports the emergence of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands.
A researcher at Princeton University in the US and at Uppsala University in Sweden have said that the new species had evolved in only two generations, although this process has been estimated much longer, due to the reproductive interbreeding between a Darwin's finch native to the island and a finch immigrant with a conical beak, Geospiza conirostris.
You can shape gold in many ways. It can be rolled into small pieces.
It can be twisted and woven into thin threads, or it can be hammered or laminated into sheets.
It can be made very fine, and glued onto another metal. It can be so fine that it has sometimes been used to decorate hand-painted images in manuscripts called "enlumined manuscripts.
That's what we call a chemical product's pH. You can make a pH indicator by using red cabbage juice.
Le jus de chou changes de couleur according to the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the chemical substance tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electron (because hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron)." #
Mix the dry powders together, then, with clean hands and moist ones, press them into a ball.
The humidity on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will produce a strange sensation and produce a shell-like feeling.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets equipped with a flush toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewa
Found remains of sewer systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman times, public baths sometimes included public toilets where men and women could mingle.
When you call someone who is thousands of kilometres away, you use a satellite.
The satellite receives the call in space and then returns it to Earth almost instantaneously.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts a part of our light and our vision.
A giant rocket is required to put a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in many ways. The greatest advantage it has brought us is that it has made transport much simpler and faster.
It has brought us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Below are medium-sized carnivores that eat medium-sized prey, including rabbits, deer and other cattle.
In addition, there are many small cats (including free-roaming cats) that eat small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
Their success is the concept of niche, a task reserved for each feline, preventing it from competing with other.
Lionesses are the most sociable cats, living in large groups called herds.
The packs are composed of one to three adult males, as well as a thirty-some females and cubs.
Women are generally very close to each other, their family being composed of a large number of sisters and daughters.
The lions act like packs of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in their behavior, and also very deadly for their prey.
Balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (but sometimes difficultly), swim, jump great distances and tow with five times the strength of a human powerful.
The tiger is part of the same family (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones capable of roaring.
The roar of the tiger does not sound like the roar of the lion, but rather like a phrase whose words would be cries and groans.
The ocelot is a voracious carnivore. It catches monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if it can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than him.
According to scientists, ocelots hunt and find prey (prey) by smelling their tracks on the ground.
They see very well at night thanks to their night vision, and they move also very stealthily. The ocelots hunt their prey by blending into their environment before leaping on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it is derived (for example, if it moves above a mountain range or a river, or if it moves to a new island so that it cannot easily return to its previous location), it often finds itself in a different environment than it was previously.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so that the new population will need new characteristics or adaptations to be a powerful competitor against what it had previously needed.
The population of origin has not changed at all, it still needs the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they will no longer be considered to belong to the same species.
We call this process "speciation", which simply means the formation of new species. It is an inevitable and very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, exhale).
Plants produce their food by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We manufacture our houses and our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The great white shark was the superpredator of the time, he didn't fear anything, except other great white sharks.
His long jaws were equipped with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, as well as a series of teeth in the palate, so that anything that crossed his path could not escape.
We are not sure, but it may have been a bit tongue-tied. His diet included turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been cannibalistic.
He also attacked everything that entered the water, including a dinosaur like a T. rex, which was not even big enough to fight him.
While the Romans ate food that we know, they ate strange or unusual dishes, including snails, pigeons, cockroaches, and the hare, a sort of rodent.
Another difference: while the poor and the woman ate their food sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to organize banquets where they rested on the side while they ate.
Roman meals of antiquity could not include these foods from the United States or Asia that were introduced into Europe centuries later.
For example, they did not have maize, tomatoes, or potatoes, nor cacao, and no Romans have ever tasted beef.
Babylonians built temples for each of their gods which were considered to be the dwellings of the god.
People sacrificed to the gods and priests tried to meet the needs of the gods by means of ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had a courtyard, then a inner sanctum, which only the priests could enter.
Some pyramidal towers, ziggurats, were sometimes built as part of a temple.
The top of the tower was a special place for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
The bulk of the Jewish family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were open-air stalls, with no doors. Houses were built of stones. 
As there were no great forests in Canaan, the wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In Scandinavian sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and that he found Greenland by travelling further west.
But regardless of her discovery, the Inuits lived there already at the time.
While each country is'scandinavian', there are many differences between the people, the kings, the customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie Benjamin Gates and the Templar Treasure, you may think that a treasure map has been drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence. 
But that is not true. Although there is an inscription on the back of the document, it is not a treasure chest.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, it read: "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776." The text is on the bottom of the document, reversed.
While nobody knows who wrote it, it is known that at an early stage of its existence, the great scroll (which measures approximately 29 inches three quarters on 24 inches) was rolled up. 
It is therefore likely that the rating was added simply as an indication.
The day of the landing and the subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
She was ruled by the French of Vichy, who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupying power instead of facing it.
On August 15, 1940, Allied forces landed in southern France, the invasion being called Operation "Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French Forces had liberated the south of France and were heading for Germany.
A civilisation is a unique culture shared by a significant number of people who live and work in cooperation, a society.
The word 'civilisation' derives from the Latin word 'civis', which means civil and is related to the Latin words 'civis', which means citizen, and 'civitas', which means city or state and which also indicates, in some way, the size of the society to which it relates.
Cities-states are the pioneers of nations. A civilisational culture involves the transmission of knowledge on several generations, a durable cultural empreinte and an equitable dissemination.
Minority cultures disappear often without leaving any historically relevant traces and are not recognised as genuine civilisations.
In the revolutionary war, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government under the Articles of the Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes and, as there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on the authorities of the state, often less cooperative, to enforce all its acts.
He did not have the power to derogate from tax laws or from customs duties between the States.
The articles required unanimous consent of all the Member States before they could be amended and the Member States took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world and it has won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
In popular sports, football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, equestrianism, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 are included.
Skiing is the most popular sport in the northern regions, Italians participating in international and Olympic events.
Japan has more than 7 000 islands (the largest being Honshu), which makes it the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of the islands that make up it, Japan is often referred to, geographically, as an 'archipelago'.
The first information about Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, while European sailors passing through the area made mention of it as Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the south-west of Taiwan, introducing a transformation of traditional practices of rice production and employing Chinese labourers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared them provinces of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat during the first Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Treaty, by which it ceded Taiwan to Japan, which was then ruling Taiwan until 1945.
The Inca citadel is made up of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the sun temple and the three-window room.
Most of the buildings adjacent to the complex have been rebuilt to provide better views of their original appearance.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and this restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format of photographic film is 35 mm; it was the most common format of film used in the late analogue era.
It is still made today, but what is important is that its image format is inherited from the digital camera sensor format.
The 35 mm format is actually 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
So, we say that the ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest of integer ratios) is 3:2.
Many common formats (APS family, for example) are equal to this aspect ratio or are close to it.
The third-party rule, which has been badly treated and often ridiculed, is a simple directive that offers a high level of protection while stimulating dynamism.
He points out that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into three vertically and horizontally.
In this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was being questioned.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has bound European states together despite the differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power touched everyone, from the King to the street urchin.
One of the Christian principles is that wealth should be used to relieve suffering and poverty, and that the church's monetary funds are there specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church was in Rome for more than 1000 years and this concentration of power and money has led many people to wonder whether this doctrine was respected.
After the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain established a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategy has proven effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade has violated international law generally accepted and codified by several international agreements of the two last centuries.
The United Kingdom mines international waters to prevent ships from venturing into entire areas of maritime jurisdiction, thereby constituting a threat even for neutral ships.
As this tactic has elicited only a timid response, Germany expected a similar response in its submarine warfare without limits.
In the 20th century, most citizens and nations showed a preference for pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, nations wished to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four hundred dollars in his name, a poem and a recommendation letter from Charles Batchelor (his previous manager) to Thomas Edison.
The ancient Chinese had a unique way of showing the different periods of China or each family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
Among each dynasty, there have also been periods of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods is the Three Kingdoms period that lasted for 60 years between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty.
In these periods, fierce battles have taken place between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms were one of the bloodiest periods in the history of Chinese ancient times. Thousands of people died in battle to sit on the throne of the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political repercussions such as the adoption of the metric system, the passing of absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people and not to one single leader.
As well, after the Revolution, all male professions were opened to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
It is also true for the army, because the ranking of armies is no longer based on the class, but on the calibre.
The French Revolution also inspired many other working class oppressed countries to embark on their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions that transcended the scope of this worldly life. He was accustomed to frequenting a cave that has become famous under the name of 'Hira' on the mountain of 'Noor' (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived to the time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad’s spiritual inclinations.
Located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find, even though we know that it exists. When we entered the cave, we were completely isolated. 
Up there, you can only look at the clear sky and the numerous mountains surrounding it. From the inside of the cave, you can only see very little of this universe.
The Great Pyramid of Gizeh is the only of the seven wonders that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians during the third millennium BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many gigantic structures erected in honour of the Pharaohs who died.
The Giza plateau, or 'Giza necropolis', in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, contains several pyramids (the largest being the most imposing), several small tombs, many temples and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built to honour the pharaoh Khéops, and many small pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honour his wives and his family.
The symbol 'push' looks like a V and the symbol 'pull' looks like a staple or a square with a missing bottom.
The high means you must begin by the tip and push the bow, and the low means you must begin by the arrow rest and pull the bow.
A bow upwards produces a softer sound, while a bow downwards produces a louder sound.
Don't forget to write your own names on the pencil, but remember that the musical pencil marks are for a musical reason, and that you should therefore generally respect them.
On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, eleven years old, and Louis-Charles, four years old), and the sister of the king, Madame Elisabeth, all terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of
In a carriage, they have gone back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who shout and scream threats against the king and the queen.
The king and queen were forced to open the windows of their carriages because of the crowd.
At a certain point, a crowd member brandished the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles before the terrified queen.
The US imperialist war expenditures in the Philippines have been paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay colonial American taxes to cover a large part of the expenses and interest of the Philippine government bonds issued by Wall Street banks.
Of course, the profits from prolonged American imperialism in the Philippines could constitute the fundamental benefits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we must understand the context in which the order was created.
These events took place during the period generally considered to be the High Middle Ages – a period of European history from the eleventh to the thirteenth century (1000-1300).
The Middle Ages Central preceded the High Middle Ages and followed by the Low Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from the technological push or the technological imperative to a strict sense of which the fate of humanity is determined by a scientifically-based logic underlying laws of nature and their manifestation in technologies.
Many interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: technological development itself is a process that transcends cultural and political influences, and technology has an impact on societies that are intrinsically conditioned rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we could say that the car is a necessary condition for road development.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a few cars, so new methods of production are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Massive ownership of cars also leads to an increased incidence of road accidents, which leads to the development of new techniques in the field of healthcare to treat the body injuries.
Romanticism presented a significant element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
Romantic theories hold that geography has shaped individuals and, over time, customs and a culture associated with this geography have emerged. These, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris is known as the capital of the modern world of fashion, Constantinople was seen as the capital of the medieval Europe.
His reputation as the centre of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until 1100 AD.
His status has declined over the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that Crusaders returned with presents such as silk and spices, with which Byzantine markets could not compete.
It was in this period that the title of European capital of fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 13th centuries.
At the beginning, the dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture, to the east.
However, due to the slowness of communication means, Western modes could lag behind by up to 25 to 30 years.
In the Middle Ages, Western Europe developed its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time, following the crusades, was the use of buttons for closing clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is a form of agriculture practiced to produce enough food for the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic, system using locally-sourced seeds, combined with crop rotation or other simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers practised subsistence farming and it is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures are groups of individuals who feel neglected by the social norms and share the same ideas which allows them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnic origin, class, location and / or sex of members.
The criteria that determine a subculture as distinctive can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
Subculture members often signal their membership by distinctive and symbolic use of style, which encompasses fashions, manias and slang.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialisation is to draw on a few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse, have not been socialised by adults during their childhood.
Children considered to be 'wild' or'savage' are often locked up by their own parents. In some cases, the abandonment of this child was due to the parents' rejection of a severe intellectual or physical disability that the child suffered.
Wild children may have suffered severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or escaping.
Others would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in the wild.
When they are raised entirely by non-human species, children raised by them display almost identical behaviours to those of their species raised, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, support goes further.
Support is not a method of learning but rather a means of helping learners who discover a new teaching method such as the use of a new programme or the start of a new project.
Supports can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but the little Microsoft Office trombone is also a form of support.
Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are intended to guide, explain and explain procedures that would have been too difficult to manage for the student alone.
Children are placed in foster care for very diverse reasons, from neglect to maltreatment, from extortion to bribery.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, attentive and educational, but that is the case.
We perceive the family placement system as a safe zone for these children.
Our family placement system is supposed to provide safe, loving homes, stable carers, stable education and reliable healthcare.
The placement in a foster family is supposed to provide all the basic needs that were lacking in the home from which they were previously removed.
Internet combines mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approach to usages and gratifications.
For example, 'learning' and'socialization' are seen as major factors promoting Internet use (James et al., 1995).
'Personal involvement' and 'continuous relationships' were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied the public reactions to Internet sites.
Video recording has led to great discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, that is, facial expressions during a few milliseconds.
They claim that you can detect if someone is lying by interpreting correctly micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, has indicated how people with brain damage are able to assess the sincerity of the speech accurately.
He suggests that such capacities for human interpretation may be found in domestic dogs.
The research of the twentieth century has shown that there are two genetic reservoirs: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and the selection removes it from the gene pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination alternate between the two drainages at each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a non-human primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet its nutritional needs from the available plant resources.
In addition, a lack of response has serious consequences: growth disorders, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult to digest for us, unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest and provide a large amount of protein containing all essential amino acids.
In all fairness, we should not be surprised if our own forefathers have solved their 'protein problem' in a similar way to chimpanzees in the savanna today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentional awakening during your sleep and subsequently falling asleep for a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
It can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock, so that you do not wake up completely.
If you find yourself resetting your clock while you are asleep, it may be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
The other possibilities based on the biorhythm include drinking a lot of liquids before going to bed (especially water or tea, reputed to be diuretics), which forces you to wake up to go to the bathroom.
The degree of peace within a person opposes to the degree of tension in his or her body and mind.
With less tension, the vitality present is positive. Each person has the opportunity to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been enriched by the path of love mahayana and by many techniques of yoga from India.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the universal love path.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (illumination energy) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The Tibetan centre of meditation is the yoga of the deity. It is through visualising different deities that the channels of energy are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of awakening is created.
Germany was a common enemy during the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, deep conflicts between their different systems, methods and cultures ended the understanding between these two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the old allies have become enemies and the Cold War has begun.
It would last for 40 years and see real conflicts, through proxy armies, on battlefields as well in Africa as in Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defence was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian head-of-the-pike.
But these plans were obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800 000 Soviet troops arrived and created the Bieloruss and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, as well as other international treaties, whether bilateral or multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient way of moving large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The work of the armed forces has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the capacity to move your people and your goods, while interfering with your enemy's capacity to move people and goods.
One of the most recent examples of this situation was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans were trying to cross the Atlantic Ocean to send troops and equipment to help the British.
At the same time, the German Navy, using mainly U-Boats, tried to stop this trade.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Great Britain as it has done for the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribal groups began to keep them close to them so they could easily access milk, fur, skins and meat.
Domestic sheep were usually kept in flocks that wandered on hills or other pastures, often cared for by shepherds who were usually children or adolescents, similar to the more familiar term of shepherds.
The 'wagonways' were built in England in the 16th century.
While the railway tracks were simply made of parallel planks of wood, they allowed horses to reach greater speeds and to carry heavier loads than on roads slightly more accident-prone during the day.
The crossbars were introduced early enough to keep the tracks in place. However, it was soon apparent that the tracks would be more effective if they were equipped with a steel bar on top.
It has become a common practice, but the iron has caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails were introduced.
The first means of locomotion was walking: humans began walking upright about two million years ago with the arrival of the Homo Erectus ("right-handed man").
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, walked on all fours as they usually did.
There are bipedal specializations in fossils of Australopithecus from 4,2 to 3,9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus could walk on two legs already seven million years ago.
We can begin by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even lobby to reduce the sufferings to come.
In many cases, it is a symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not just want a temporary solution, we have to find the root of the problems and disable them.
It is clear that the world has changed a great deal thanks to the scientific and technological advances made by human beings, and that the problems have become more serious because of overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a draft manuscript signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to a few blocks away, to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
In the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, known as "Dunlap Broadsides.
The public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the Independence Hall court on 8 July.
One of them was sent to George Washington on 6 July, which was read to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy was received in London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap sheets that are known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript copy has not survived.
Many palaeontologists now believe that a dinosaur group survived and is still alive. They are called birds.
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly.
But there are still a lot of things that look like dinosaurs.
They have scales on their feet and claws, they lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on information manipulation that is encoded in binary form.
A binary number can have only one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary numbers, or bits for using the computer jargon.
An internal poisoning can not be seen immediately. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are sufficiently general to allow a prompt diagnosis to be made.
The best indicator of internal poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of toxic household chemicals or medicines.
Look at the label to find out the specific first aid instructions for this poison.
The term 'insect' is used by entomologists in a formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
This term derives from an old familiarity with bed bugs, which are very adapted to parasitizing humans.
The red ants, like bed bugs, are nidicolous, i.e. adapted to live in the nest or habitat of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400 000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, consisting of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A couple can very well estimate that it is not in their interest, nor in the child's interest, to look after the child's education.
These couples can choose to adopt their baby.
In the context of adoption, biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main objective of science is to understand how the world works by scientific method. This method guides in fact most scientific research.
It is, however, not the only, experimentation, and an experiment is a test which serves to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, pose questions and make observations, but which also orients scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers have focused on ancient texts, and in particular on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's opinions on all scientific questions, including psychology, have been accepted.
With the decline of knowledge of Greek, Western civilisation has been cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed physiological and behavioural rhythms are often dependent on the presence of endogenous circadian rhythms and their production by circadian clocks.
Periodically recurring rhythms, which do not simply represent periodic responses to external stimuli, have been found for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
The biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to operate for a certain period even without external stimulation.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacteria.
They have carried out two experiments to mark the DNA of the phage with a radioactive phosphorus, or the protein of the phage with a radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the extent of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only the genetic mutations of the germ cells can be passed on to the children, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism is aimed at people who want to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, in particular flora and fauna.
Hunting, fishing, bird watching, photographing, observing birds, visiting parks and studying the information on the ecosystem are examples of activities on the spot.
You can, for example, go to see, photograph and discover the orang-utans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small towns in the countryside by car to get to their place of work and cross other people who are going to work in the country they have just left.
A dynamic, moving bus service, each passenger is connected to a private car-based transport system and supports it.
Science now shows that this massively carbon-based economy has pushed the biosphere out of its stable state which has supported human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about water quality or bridge collapses.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they break down every day? Transport engineers are simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movements of drivers and vehicles between two points, and the interactions they exert between themselves.
It is difficult to study the traffic flow because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with 100 % certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act in a reasonable range; so, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically in an approximate manner.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) the flow, (2) the density and (3) the speed.
These relationships help to plan, design and operate road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly enabled them to escape more easily from their enemies and to find more effectively food and companions.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their bodies.
It gives them a greater number of small hideouts from predators.
Today, only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and ephemerals.
In a few thousand years, a man called Aristotle asserted that the solar system moved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many thought the opposite: that the solar system moved around the earth, including the sun (and even the other stars).
It seems reasonable, because the Earth does not feel the slightest movement, is it not?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times the volume of water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the world's largest river, reaching up to 10 km wide.
About 20 % of the water that falls from rivers on the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main branch of the Amazon River is 6 387 km (3 980 miles) long. It collects the water of thousands of small rivers.
While the construction of pyramids continued up to the end of the Old Kingdom, the Great Pyramid of Gizeh has never been surpassed in size and the quality of its construction.
Ancien Egyptians were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, who had then been in existence for more than a thousand years.
Vatican City has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and the least populated.
The Vatican City drafts its legislation and official communications in Italian.
Italian is also the language of everyday use by most of the people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican City are Catholic.
From antiquity, people have been familiar with basic elements such as gold, silver and copper, for they are found in nature in their pure form and are easy to mine using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, has theorised that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. It was earth, water, air and fire.
It was more about the four states of matter (in the same order) : solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although he also made the case that these latter would transform into new substances to form what we see.
Aluminium alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered as metals. Of course, there are also metals such as gold and silver.
There are also alloys which contain a small amount of non-metal elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of minuscule particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that billions of them could enter the period at the end of this sentence.
So, a pencil was a good friend to many people when it was released.
Unfortunately, the appearance of new modes of writing has relegated the pen to a more private status and has been used less frequently.
People are now writing messages on computer screens, without ever having to get near a pencil.
It is only a question of time before the next new thing arrives.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it combines a nucleus of a myriad of protons and neutrons.
Like if you were to make a hill climb by dragging a heavy cart up a hill.
Some atoms have a volatile nucleus, so that they tend to break up with little or no pressure.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust. Its outer layer is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the visible side and 100 km on the hidden side.
She is finer at sea level and thicker at the continent.
There may be more lava on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are focused on the search for what makes people feel good or attracted.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they matured into adulthood.
These theories examine what drives some people to want what they do and what, in their environment, drives them to do or not do what they do.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and the two-factor theory of Herzberg.
Generally speaking, two behaviours can emerge when a manager becomes the boss of former colleagues. At one end of the spectrum is trying to stay 'the good friend' (or 'the good girlfriend').
A manager of this type is unable to take controversial decisions, carry out disciplinary actions, carry out risk assessments, delegate responsibilities, and hold others to account.
At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes a disfigured individual who feels that he/she must change everything that the group has created up to now and do things his/her way.
After all, the head is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behaviour often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical team.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet at different times, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a real "invisible" team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also an unique element of a virtual team.
The "invisible" team is the team of management to which each member reports. It establishes the standards for each of them.
Why would an organisation want to create a structure for learning? One of the objectives of implementing organisational concepts of learning is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in functional services of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can be fully expressed.
Thus, a process of working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new process of innovation to meet the needs of the customer.
Before an organisation becomes innovative, its leadership must create an innovation culture, shared knowledge and its own innovation culture of learning.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organisations achieve better results.
Neuroscientific data provide material evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research. They allow researchers to reduce the field of research and to make it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of damage, lesions, tumours and brain trauma affect behaviour and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rapid development of new technologies has enabled us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build models of simulation which help us to understand the processes in our minds.
Although Artificial Intelligence is often strongly associated with science fiction, it is an important part of computer science which studies intelligent behaviour, learning and adaptation.
The research in artificial intelligence is aimed at automating tasks requiring an intelligent approach.
In the examples are included control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnostics and customer questions, as well as recognition of writing, voice and face.
This practice has led to distinctive disciplines, focused on providing solutions to everyday problems.
The system of the IA is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and military, as it has been put into practice in several home computer software and video games.
Excursions are integral to any school class. Often, a teacher would like to take his pupils to places where a bus journey is not possible.
The solution is provided by technology in the form of virtual educational excursions. Students can view ancient objects from a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a beautiful work of art while sitting in their classroom.
Participating practically to a trip is also a good way of thinking about a trip and sharing your experiences with future generations.
For example, students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design each year a website dedicated to their visit to the capital of the state. Each year, the site is updated, but the old versions are kept online for use as an album.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Even if students often try blogging with poor grammar and spelling, the fact that they have a public makes it more likely that the situation will improve.
As students are often the most critical audience, the author of the blog is beginning to try to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging "forces students to be more intelligent and interesting" (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are an effective tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning well beyond the traditional school day.
When used well, blogs can enable students to strengthen their analytical and critical thinking skills: by responding actively to online content, they can confront their own opinion with that of others and present their own views on specific topics.
Ottawa is the charming capital bilingual of Canada and has a large number of art galleries and museums that highlight the past and present of Canada.
You'll find more south and to the north the falls of Niagara and the region of Muskoka and its environs which possess a virgin natural beauty.
All these measures, and many more, make Ontario what foreigners regard as the quintessence of Canada.
A large part of the northern regions are sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited in the wild.
For a comparison that will surprise even the most observant: There are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The islands of the East African coast lie in the Indian Ocean, off the east African coast.
Madagascar is by far the largest country, and even a continent by itself, in terms of wildlife.
Most of the small islands are independent nations or associated with France, and are known for luxury beach resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam into the land and this religion has spread widely to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route linking Europe to India.
North, the region is defined by the Sahel, and to the south and east by the Atlantic Ocean.
To women: It is recommended that any woman who travels say that she is married, regardless of her marital status.
It is also advised to wear a wedding ring (which should not seem too precious.)
Women must realize that some cultural differences may lead to behaviours they regard as harassment. It is common that they are followed, caught by the arm, etc.
Be firm in your refusal of advances, and do not be afraid to stand your ground (cultural or not, that does not mean it is acceptable!)
Modern Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Mernaides as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese, who after it had been destroyed had rebuilt it and named it Casa Branca, had finally abandoned it in 1755 after a quake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city under the name of Daru l-Badya, and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in all of Morocco for shopping.
Around the old medina, you can easily find places where you can buy traditional Moroccan products, such as tajines, pottery, leather goods, nargilehs and all sorts of bibelots.
Goma is a tourist town located in the extreme east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city centre.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, all visits to the outside of Goma should be subject to investigation to understand the state of fighting that continues in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of Nyiragongo volcano as well as for gorilla tracking treks among the least expensive in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motor taxi) to get around in Goma. The normal fare (local) is about 500 CFA francs for a short trip.
Combined with its relative remoteness, 'Tombouctou' has become a metaphor for the remote and exotic countries.
Today, Tombouctou is a poor city, although its reputation as a tourist attraction makes it a popular destination, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the World Heritage List in danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the major steps in the " Wonders of the African World " series on PBS.
The city contrasts starkly with the rest of the country, because it has a more Arab style than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the southern border is the Crocodile River." #
The total area of the park is 19 500 km2, which is divided into 14 ecozones, each of which contains a specific fauna.
This is one of the most famous South African National Parks and regarded as the jewel in the SANParks crown.
As for all South African national parks, there are daily entry and conservation fees.
It may be advantageous to purchase a Wild Card that gives access to some South African national parks, as well as all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the namesake of the territory of Hong Kong and represents a major tourist attraction for many tourists.
The row of skyscrapers that forms the horizon of Hong Kong was compared to a shimmering bar chart, which is reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To admire the most beautiful views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to Kowloon's front line located opposite.
The vast majority of the urban development of Hong Kong is concentrated on the northern terraces.
This is the place that the British colonists have invested. Thus, I think it is a good starting point, if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this region.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest mangrove forest belt, extending for 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the back-country of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forest area located on the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not only made up of mangrove swamps: they also contain some of the last vestiges of the majestic jungles that covered the plains of the Ganges once.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3 850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water/wetlands.
Sundarbans is a national park since 1966, you will find there about 400 Bengal tigers and 30 000 spotted deer.
The buses leave the district bus station (on the other side of the river) all day long, but most, especially those that go to the east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6 and 7 a.m.
Inter-district buses are often full, so it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese ships, which are comfortable and robust.
The shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to get to places near, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock Bridge is a suspension bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint George in Guyana.
The two towers are 83 metres high; they are 378 metres long and have two 3,50 m wide lanes.
The vertical displacement under the bridge is 15 metres. The structure was completed in August 2011, but it was opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge should be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs posts should be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group in what is now the eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also practising subsistence agriculture.
Other indigenous tribes that populated the Chaco, such as the Guaycurú or the Payaguá, survived primarily by fishing, hunting, or gathering.
In 1516, Paraguay was born from the meeting between Spanish conquistadors and the indigenous people.
The Spanish colonized the period of colonization, which lasted for three centuries.
From the foundation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain a large part of its native character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best teams and among the best players in polo in the world.
The biggest polo tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
In addition, smaller tournaments and matches are sometimes organised here at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and places to buy tickets for polo matches, see the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Isle of Man is the Manx pound (FKP), which is equivalent to a pound sterling (GBP).
The money can be exchanged at the only bank in Stanley, on the island of Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
The pound sterling is a widely accepted currency in the islands, while in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the nearby islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, even if it is possible that British and American dollars will be accepted. Talk to the owners in advance about a payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange money from the Maldives outside the islands, so change it before you leave the islands.
Montevideo being located in the southern hemisphere, winter in the northern hemisphere corresponds to summer there and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical zone and summer temperatures exceeding 30 °C are common.
Winter can be misleadingly cold: temperatures rarely fall below zero, but wind and humidity combine to give the impression that it is colder than what the thermometer says.
There are no 'dry' and 'wet' seasons: rainfall is almost constant throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, they are still wild animals; please do not feed them or disturb them.
According to the park authorities, you must stay at least 100 metres away from bears and wolves and at least 25 metres away from all other wild animals!
As placid as they may appear, deer, elk, moose, and almost all the great animals can attack.
Each year, hundreds of visitors are injured because they did not keep a sufficient distance from wild animals. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them some space.
In addition, know that odors attract wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking odoriferous foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of about 40 000 people.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and is the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a naval standoff that was a sadly famous one in 1889 when seven German, American and British ships refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans perished.
The Supreme Head of the Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was assassinated during a peaceful rally held in the city during the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement.
The beaches are numerous, because Auckland is on the border of two ports. The most popular ones are located in three zones.
The North Shore beaches are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay north to Devonport south.
Most of the beaches are sandy and allow safe swimming, and most are shaded by the Pohutukawa.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the chic suburb of Mission Bay and in the centre of Auckland.
The beaches, often very popular with families, have many shops along the coast. Swimming is safe there.
The main local beer is the "Number One", a rather ordinary beer, but tasty and refreshing. There is also another local beer, the "Manta".
There are many French wines to taste, but New Zealand and Australian wines may travel better.
You can drink the tap water locally without any risk, but you can easily find bottled water if you have any concerns about it.
For Australians, the idea of a 'cream coffee' is foreign. A black coffee is an 'espresso', a cappuccino is filled with cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is Belgian standard compliant. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries due to one of these causes on the reef are rare.
However, follow the advice of authorities, obey all warning signs and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
From October to April, north of 1770, the box jellyfish arrive near beaches and estuaries of rivers. They can also sometimes be seen outside of this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most of them are afraid of humans and would run away.
Salmon crocodiles do not live actively in the saltwater ocean, their main habitat is in estuary rivers in north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveller the peace of mind that he will have somewhere to sleep once he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but you can also book accommodation through travel agencies of other types of accommodation, such as camping sites.
Travel agencies usually offer breakfast, airport transfers or even packages combining flights and accommodation.
They can also reserve your place if you need time to think about the offer or to procure other documents necessary for your destination (for example, a visa).
Any change or request must however be made to the travel agency first and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants decide to camp on site, and most consider that this is an integral part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the musical event, you will have to arrive early to find a well-placed camping site.
Don't forget that even if the concerts are over on the main stages, other concerts can continue until late at night on other sites of the festival.
Some festivals have special family camping areas.
If you cross the north of the Baltic in winter, be sure to check the location of the hut, as the crossing of the ice can cause unbearable noise at the most exposed huts.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time spent in the city. Passengers on cruise ships are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos generally make a lot of efforts to maximise the time and money spent by customers. There are rarely windows and clocks, and exits can be difficult to spot.
They usually offer special offers of food, drinks and entertainment in order to keep the guests happy and to keep them there.
On some sites, it is the locals who offer free alcoholic beverages. However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good players should know that it is crucial to remain sober.
Anyone who travels to high latitudes or crosses mountains must consider the possibility of snow, ice or cold temperatures.
On the icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you cannot drive like you are on the asphalt.
While the blizzards are raging, it can fall quite a lot of snow in very little time to block you.
The visibility can also be limited by snow or ice or by condensation or frost on the windows of vehicles.
In addition, the presence of ice and snow is normal in many countries, and the traffic is virtually continuous all year round.
Safaris are perhaps the greatest attraction in Africa and the most memorable moment for many visitors.
Safari" is a common term in everyday language for an African excursion, and especially for a safari in the African savanna, with the aim of witnessing the amazing spectacle of wild animals in their natural habitat.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars very close and standard equipment allows them to be observed very closely.
Lion, cheetah and leopards are sometimes timid and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as 'walking in the bush', 'walking safari' or 'footing') consists of walking, either for a few hours, or for several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will take place in other venues throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympic Games, after hosting the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you will be in a tricky situation.
The policies of cancellation vary, but from mid-March, most cancellation policies based on the coronavirus do not extend to July 2020, the date on which the Olympics had been scheduled.
We expect most events tickets to cost between 2 500 and 130 000 yens, typical tickets costing around 7 000 yens.
Drying wet clothes can be easier. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards which can be loaned, even if there is no iron in the room. 
If you do not have a iron or do not want to wear ironed socks, you can try to use a hairdryer, if you find one.
Don't leave the fabric too hot (which can cause shrinkage or in extreme cases, burn it).
There are different methods of water purification, including some that are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it is enough to boil water for a minute; in others, it is necessary to boil it for several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you have a problem, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter unfamiliar animals that they do not know in their home region.
Parasites can contaminate food, cause irritations or, in the most serious cases, cause allergic reactions, spread venom or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can wound or kill people by force, are not usually considered parasites.
In some areas, shops that are exempt from taxes and duties are an opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and duties.
Travellers to countries where taxes are high can sometimes save a great deal of money, in particular on alcoholic beverages or tobacco.
The Buffalo-Pittsburgh section of the interstate highway is the most difficult section of the highway, passing through isolated backcountry areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep an open mind: steep slopes, narrow roads and tight bends predominate.
Speed limits displayed are significantly lower than in previous sections and following – usually between 35 and 40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and stricter compliance is still more important than before.
On the other hand, mobile phone service is surprisingly much stronger here than on many other parts of the road, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cakes are rather good, and in Bavaria, they are very rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbour, Austria.

A curry dish can be'solid' or 'liquid', depending on the amount of sauce it contains.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in the south of India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesia having 17 000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines present in all of the country.
However, when this term is used without any other qualification, it tends to designate the food from the central and eastern parts of the island of Java.
Now, widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a wide range of simple dishes, the predominant flavours being the nuts, chillies, sugar (especially the coconut sugar of Java) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are the feet of the rider, which hang from each side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability to the user, but they can pose a security problem: for example, the user's feet can get trapped.
If a horse is thrown from a horse, but has a leg caught in the stirrup, it could be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimise this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth sole and a fairly narrow heel.
After that, some stools, in particular the English, have safety bars which allow a rider to fall off the saddle if the rider is pulled back by a rider who falls.
Valley of Cochamó – The Chilean Yosemite, with many different granite peaks and cliffs, and a number of different routes.
From the top of the mountains, the panoramas are unobstructed. The mountaineers of the world have discovered new routes practicable on the slopes, where the possibilities are limitless. 
Skiing and snowboarding are popular sports that involve sliding down a snowy slope with skis or snowboards attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity that has many fans, sometimes called "ski bums", who organize their entire holidays around skiing in specific places.
The idea of skiing is very ancient: some prehistoric paintings show skiers dating for some of 5 000 years ago!
Skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 16th century; the first ski club in recreational skiing was founded in 1861 in Australia by Norwegians. 
Skiing: this activity is also referred to as Nordic skiing, cross-country skiing or hiking.
It resembles alpine skiing, as well as alpine climbing, but does not generally include these activities, which are practiced on rugged terrain and require the use of much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of skiing as a hiking route in the same way.
In good conditions, you can walk a little further than you would normally walk – but you will rarely reach the speeds of skiing without a heavy pack on a damned ski slope.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but containing numerous independent countries. In normal circumstances, travelling through several countries involves the need to apply for several visas and to undergo several passport checks.
Schengen, however, works a little bit like one country in this regard.
As long as you remain within this area, you can usually cross the border without having to go through passport controls.
In addition, having a Schengen visa means you don't need to apply separately for each of the Member States' visa, which saves time, money and administrative procedures.
There is no universal definition of an antique that can be applied to all objects manufactured. Some tax authorities define objects over 100 years old as antiquities.
The criteria vary according to where one is located; in some parts of the world, such as in North America, the age limit can be lower than that in force in Europe.
Artisanal products can be considered as antiquities even though they are less ancient than similar industrial products.
Ranging reindeer herding is a major means of subsistence for Samis and the culture surrounding this trade is of great importance to many other professions.
Although, according to tradition, all Samis did not participate in large-scale reindeer farming, they lived mainly from fishing, hunting and other similar activities, and used reindeer mainly as livestock.
Today, many Samis practice modern jobs. Tourism is an important source of income in Lapland, the Sami region.
While widely used, especially among non-Roma, the term 'Gitan' is often considered to be pejorative because of its association with negative stereotypes and a distorted image of the Roma people.
If the country in which you are going to be affected by a travel warning issued by your government, your health insurance abroad or your travel insurance can be affected.
You can also consult other governments, but their advice is tailored to their citizens.
As an example, American citizens in the Middle East could be faced with different situations from those faced by Europeans or Arabs.
Advice is a brief summary of the political situation of a country.
The opinions presented are often superficial, general and too simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Violent weather is the generic term for any hazardous weather phenomenon that may cause damage, social disruption or human loss.
Very adverse weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and they can be of several kinds, depending on the geographical, topographical and meteorological features.
Violent winds, hail, excessive precipitation and forest fires are forms and effects of violent weather, just as tornadoes, hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones are.
Extreme weather phenomena, regional and seasonal, include cold winters, snowstorms with violent winds, and sandstorms or dust storms.
It is strongly recommended that travellers check the weather forecast for their destination region, knowing that it may have an impact on their travel plans.
Anyone considering going to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive appropriate professional training.
A search on the Internet for 'Cours in hostile environment' will probably provide the address of a local business.
A course will cover the issues raised here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
The training usually lasts for two to five days and includes role playing, first aid, and sometimes training in the use of weapons.
Wildlife books and magazines are common, but war-zone publications are scarce.
Travellers planning to undergo a gender reassignment abroad must ensure that they have valid travel documents for their return journey.
Governments are increasingly issuing passports with the gender of the bearer not indicated (X) or updating documents to correspond to the desired name and sex.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents varies greatly.
The security checks at checkpoints have become much more intrusive in the post-11 September era.
Transsexual people in the pre-op phase should not be expected to undergo scanners in order to preserve their privacy and dignity.
Swell breakers are the swells that return from the breakers that break on the beach, often on a reef or equivalent.
Because of the underwater topography, the return flow is concentrated on a few sections deeper, and a fast current can form in the deeper waters.
In most cases, deaths are due to exhaustion which results from attempting to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
When you leave the current, swimming back is not more difficult than usual.
You may not be able to hit the target if you are being watched.
The cultural shock occurs earlier than the cultural shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer and is more serious.
Travellers who have had difficulty adjusting to the new culture have sometimes a lot of difficulty adjusting to their home culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and have lost some of your native culture.
At first, when you travelled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travellers in a new country must adapt.
People may not be anticipating that patience and understanding are also necessary for travellers and travellers returning home.
The light and sound show at the Pyramid is one of the most interesting attractions in the region for children.
You can see the pyramids in the darkness and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
Often, you hear the sound of tourists and peddlers. The history of sound and light is like a history book.
The Sphinx is placed as the backdrop and the narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and the different pyramids are lit.
The Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the largest number of research stations and 16 of them are active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the mainland. The island of King George, with the village of Villa Las Estrellas, is the largest.
Other examples: Livingston Island and the disappointment, where the active caldera of a still active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbour.
Ellsworth Land is the eastern part of the Balkan Peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula sink into the plateau, then reappear to form the Ellsworth Range, 360 kilometres long and traversed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, contains the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which stands at 4892 m.
In remote areas without cellular network, you may not have any other choice but to resort to satellite telephony.
A satellite phone is not usually a substitute for a mobile phone, because you need to be outside and have a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
It is a common service used by navigation, including recreational boats, as well as by expeditions that require data transmission and telephony.
Your local telephone operator should be able to tell you more about the connection to this service.
Sabbatical leavers have the opportunity to learn while travelling, and more and more of them are choosing this option.
This is particularly popular with young people who drop out of school, because it allows them to take a year off before university, without compromising their studies.
Often, taking a year off to study abroad can actually give you better chances of going on to study at university in your own country.
Generally, you have to pay tuition fees to take these educational programmes.
Finland is a popular destination for boating. The "Land of the thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, in lakes and archipelagos on the coast.
You do not necessarily need a yacht in the archipelago and on lakes.
While the archipelago coasts and the largest lakes are in fact quite large for a boat, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Recreational boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden and New Zealand are in the same situation, but apart from that, it is a unique case (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises are characterised by a prolonged stay in St Petersburg, in Russia.
It means that you can visit the historic city for several days in the entirety and return to sleep on the boat at night.
If you do not go to the ground with cruises, you will not need a separate visa (from 2009).
Berlin, in Germany, is mentioned in some cruise brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not at all located near the sea and no visit to this city is included in the cruise price. 
Travelling by air can be a terrifying experience for all ages and from all walks of life, particularly if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It's not shameful to admit that it's not different from personal fears and worries that many people have about other things.
To some, understanding something about the workings of aircraft and what happens during a flight can help to overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or on the fact that you do not have control.
The fast delivery companies are well paid to deliver fast. Often, in an urgent repair, the question of time is crucial for documents, goods or spare parts that relate to them.
On some roads, large companies have their own aircraft, but on other roads and for small businesses, there has been a problem.
If they had sent goods by air freight, on some routes, it would have taken days to clear customs and to get the goods to the port.
The only way to do it was to send it as registered baggage. Airline regulations will not allow them to send a bag without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The easiest way to travel in first class or business class is to pay a large sum of money for this privilege (or, better still, ask your company to do it for you).
But that's not cheap: in general, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal business class fare and up to eleven times for first class!
Generally, it is not necessary to seek discounts for business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that they can count on certain types of passengers who are willing to pay very high prices for the privileges of speed and comfort, and they set their fares on the basis of knowledge.
The capital of the Republic of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is very common.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that is suffering from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict resulted in the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, with its own government and currency, but recognized by no country in the UN.
The economic links have been restored between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Eastern Orthodox Christianity.
With a population of 3.7 million, İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey, the second port after Istanbul, and a good platform for correspondence.
What was once the ancient city of Smyrna is today a modern commercial centre, developed and thriving, located around an enormous bay, surrounded by mountains.
Large boulevards, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping centres are dotted with traditional red tiled roofs, the 17th century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has a Mediterranean atmosphere reminiscent of Europe rather than the traditional Turkish city.
Haldarsvík is a small village on the island of Eysturoy, which is home to an unusual octagonal church.

In travelling north, do not miss the beautiful Fatima Shrine (temple), a world-famous place for the apparitions of Mary.
Don't forget that you are visiting a mass grave, as well as a site that has a very important meaning for a large part of the world's population.
There are still many people alive who survived their stay here, and many others who saw their loved ones murdered or killed by forced labour, Jews or not Jews, regardless of their religion.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Don't make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Don't ruin the site by defacing or scratching graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and almost everyone is able to speak Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, because the law establishes that it is the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other installations.
Regular announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan, but unforeseen disruptions are announced by an automated system in many languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
The Parisians have a reputation for being egocentric, rude and arrogant.
While this stereotype is often inaccurate, the best way to get along in Paris is to behave as someone of good manners. This will make your travels much easier.
The abrupt exteriors of Parisians disappear quickly if you are able to display the very minimum of courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely wooded, mainly of beech, pine and oak, and presents a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
The country has a great variety of plant communities because of its diversity of microclimates, soils and altitudes.
The region also has a very large variety of animal and bird species.
Rare species such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the owl, the lynx, the wild cat and the great tit can be seen there, as well as many common species.
When women visit a monastery, they must cover their knees and cover their shoulders as well.
Most monasteries provide scarves to women who arrive without anything, but if you bring your own scarf, and if it is also brightly coloured, you will get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
As men should wear trousers covering the knees.
You can also borrow this garment from the stockroom, but as it is not washed after each use, it is possible that you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. A single size for men!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (mainly pork), and relies on olive oil.

All names, followed by the word Sie which means you, begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
It is a good way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It can also be said that it facilitates reading, although the writing is somewhat complicated by the need to know whether a verb or an adjective is used substantively.
The pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, because most of the words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to watch are the c and g, because their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Please also ensure that you pronounce 'r' and 'rr' distinctly : 'caro' means 'dear', while 'carro' means 'cart'.

In other words, reading this introduction to Persian grammar would help you to learn a lot about Persian grammar and to better understand Persian sentences.
Needless to say, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, those who speak a little Spanish might conclude prematurely that the Portuguese is sufficiently close to Spanish to be studied separately.
Premodern observatories are usually outdated today, and remain as museums or educational sites.
As the light pollution of their time was not as serious as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, easier to access than those built in the modern era.
Modern astronomical observatories are enormous infrastructures placed in remote regions where the conditions are favourable.
Hanami, the Japanese tradition of viewing the cherry blossoms, is part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept came from China where plum blossoms were the favourite flower.
In Japan, the first Cherry Blossom Festival was organised by the Emperor only for himself and the other members of the close circle around the Imperial Court.
Plants look their best when they are in a natural environment, resist the temptation to take just one.

Christmas is one of the most important Christian festivals, it celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Many traditions associated with these festivals have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-believers throughout the world.
It is customary to spend Easter awake at a place exposed to the sun to see the sunrise.
Of course there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be that it is a spring and fertility ritual pre-Christian.
Traditional churches often hold a vigil on Easter Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, congregations often breaking into the celebration at midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that arrived on these islands originated by water, swimming or on board floating objects, or by air.
Because of the great distance between the islands, the giant tortoise has not been able to complete its journey, making it the main animal of pasture for the Galapagos tortoise.
From the arrival of man to the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including cattle, horses, cows, sheep, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will be able to witness the polar night, during which the sun does not rise above the horizon.
It is an excellent opportunity to admire the northern lights, because the sky will be dark almost all day.
As the areas are sparsely populated, and pollution from light is not a problem, you can also enjoy the stars.
Japanese culture is more hierarchical and formal than that which Westerners are used to.
The costumes are classic workwear, and employees are referred to by their first name or by their job title.
Work-life harmony is crucial, because it places the emphasis on collective effort rather than on individual achievements.
Workers must often obtain the agreement of their superiors before taking any decision and are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without asking questions.
