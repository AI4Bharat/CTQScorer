It confirms not only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that has been very widely accepted, but provides details that the fossils cannot usually provide, such as the colour and the arrangement in three dimensions.
Scientists say that this bird's feathers were brown-tan on the top and pale or carotened on the bottom.
This discovery also helps us to understand the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a fully developed root, but show other characteristics that are typical of feathers – bristles and barbules – researchers have concluded that the root was probably an evolutionary development later on.
The plumage structure suggests that the feathers were not used in flight but rather for temperature regulation or display.
The scientists say that this is indeed the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, but the sample reveals a plumage belonging to an adult, and not to a juvenile.
A car bomb exploded at the headquarters of the police in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.

She first competed in the slalom where she received a "did not finish" (DNF) during her first race. 36 of 116 competitors received the same result in this race.
Her other race, the giant slalom, enabled her to finish tenth in the women's sitting group with a combined time of 4:41.30, that is 2:11.60 minutes slower than the Austrian Claudia Loesch, who won, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani, who finished ninth
In the category of women sitting skiers, four skiers did not finish their race; in the slalom, 45 skiers on a total of 117 skiers did not finish their race. 
The police of Madhya Pradesh have recovered the stolen computer and mobile phones.
The Inspector General's Deputy D. K. Arya said: "We have arrested five people for violating the Swiss citizen, and we have recovered her mobile phone and her laptop.
The accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the police commissioner, said that the accused had been covered up when they appeared before the court.
While three people were present in the house when the car hit it, no one was injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The road where the accident took place was temporarily closed to allow rescue services to extract the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He then transferred to the Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son by the Sheriff Court of Edinburgh.
She is in custody awaiting trial, but eyewitness testimony could be compromised because her portrait has been widely disseminated.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but the Scottish courts operate differently and have considered that publishing photographs could be prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, of Dundee University, notes that "journalists seem to be following a dangerous line if they publish photographs, etc. of suspects.
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is responsible for the entire case, has said that no further comment will be made at least until the prosecution is completed.
According to the leak, the document will deal with the dispute at the border that the Palestinians claim on the basis of existing borders before the Middle East war of 1967.
The other topics discussed included the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for a maximum of ten years from the signing of an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority only agrees to a five-year term.
The shooters of the additional parasite control trial were closely monitored by rangers, because the trial was controlled and its efficacy assessed.
In the context of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) inc., qualified volunteers have been recruited, in the context of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, temporary manager of the NPWS's conservation area and heritage, the four hunters named for the first autumn kill were properly trained and instructed in safety procedures.
Martelly has just installed a provisional electoral council (CEP) made up of nine members. 
It is the fifth PEC of Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the dissolution of the previous CEP in the context of a package of measures aimed at engaging the country on the path to new elections.
This commission was the response of Martelly to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the absence of elections, which were due to take place in 2011.
Around 60 iPods that overheated have been reported, causing six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been informed of 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy and Technology announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which it described as 'non-serious'.
The Ministry has reacted by calling it "really regrettable" that the report was postponed by Apple.
The earthquake struck the Mariannes at 7:19 p.m. local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The Bureau of Emergency Management for the Northern Mariana Islands has stated that no damage has been reported in this country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has stated that there is no sign of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at tourists.
A number of hostages have been rescued, and six of them have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released prematurely, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took over the place of a lady who needed to go to the loo. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in the footsteps of his father and became a doctor.
He followed a training course in obstetrics, and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When he worked at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature births during his free time. 
His research has shown that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the lung maturation of the baby.
Xinhua reported that the government investigators recovered two flight recorders (black boxes) on Wednesday.
Other fighters also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna died the night of two moons. A unique moment, just like she. A strong woman.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as strange as me... or even more... I love her and she will be missed... I hope she rests in a better place.
A survey of 1,400 people before the federal elections in 2010 revealed that opposition to the transformation of Australia into a republic had increased by 8 % since 2008. 
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the federal election campaign that she thought Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of those surveyed share this view, and wish that Queen Elizabeth II is the last monarch to rule Australia.
On the extremes of the poll, 29 % of those questioned think that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 % think that Australia should never become a republic.
The gold medal winner at the Olympic Games was expected to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his fitness was questioned.
He was unable to take the necessary medicines to overcome his pain, these being banned within the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the 25th of January the largest known prime number.
Several people have checked the discovery using different materials and software at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
The comets may have been a source of water for the earth, as well as organic matter that can form proteins and promote life.
The scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, and particularly how the Earth was formed, because comets have collided with it for a long time.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, 53, began his term in office in January and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He has described the rumours as 'political chatter and nonsense'.
We think he will be the President's candidate in 2016.
According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that would allow aircraft to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, reducing carbon emissions.
It is based on satellite technology, and not on ground-based radar systems used previously, which enables air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more detailed information.
The additional transport is not available and the surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and the parking and relay stations are not available on the ground.
The fear of not having enough transport has led to the possibility that the match could be played behind closed doors, without the supporters of the teams.
A study published on Thursday in Science has reported the emergence of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and at Uppsala University in Sweden have indicated that the new species had evolved in only two generations, although this process has been estimated to have taken much longer, due to the reproductive interbreeding between a Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the finch immigrant with conical beak, Geospiza conirostris.
You can shape gold in many ways. It can be rolled into tiny pieces.
It can be drawn fine, which can be twisted and woven. It can be hammered or laminated into sheets.
It can be made very thin, and glued to another metal. It can be so thin that it has sometimes been used to decorate hand-painted images in manuscripts called "enlumined manuscripts.
That's what we call a chemical pH. You can make an indicator by using carrot juice.
The juice of cabbage changes colour according to the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the chemical tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electron (because hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron)." #
Mix the dry powders together, then, with clean hands and moist ones, press them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will produce an odd sensation and produce a shell-like feeling.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets equipped with a flush system in almost all houses, connected to a sophisticated se
Found remains of sewer systems in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In the Roman Empire, the toilets sometimes made up part of public baths where men and women met.
When you call someone who is thousands of kilometres away, you use a satellite.
The satellite receives the call in space and then returns it to Earth almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts a part of our light and vision.
We need a giant rocket of more than 30 meters in height to put a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in many ways. The greatest advantage it has given us is making transport much simpler and faster.
This has brought us the train, the car and many other modes of transport.
Below are medium-sized carnivores that eat smaller prey, including rabbits, deer and other cattle.
In addition, there are many small cats (including free-roaming cats) that eat small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a task specially assigned to each feline, preventing it from competing with the other.
Lion cats are the most sociable cats, living in large groups called herds.
The packs are composed of one to three adult males, as well as a thirty-some females and cubs.
Women are generally very close to each other, their family being made up of many sisters and daughters.
Lion troops act like packs of wolves or dogs, animals which are remarkably similar to lions (but not to other large cats) in their behaviour, and also very deadly for their prey.
Balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (but sometimes difficultly), swim, jump great distances and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is part of the same family (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones capable of roaring.
The roar of the tiger does not sound like the roar of the lion, but rather like a phrase whose words would be cries and groans.
The ocelot is a carnivore. It hunts small animals. It catches monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if it can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than him.
According to scientists, ocelots sniff out prey (prey) by smelling their tracks on the ground.
They see very well at night thanks to their night vision, and they move very stealthily. The ocelots hunt their prey by blending into their environment before leaping on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it is derived (for example, if it moves over a mountain range or a river, or if it moves to a new island so that it cannot easily return to its former location), it often finds itself in a different environment than it was previously.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need new traits or adaptations to be a powerful competitor against what it had before.
The population of origin has not changed at all, she still needs the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they will no longer be considered to be members of the same species.
We call this process "speciation", which simply means the formation of new species. It is an inevitable and very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, exhale).
Plants produce their food by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The mosasaur was the superpredator of the time, he didn't fear anything, except other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were equipped with more than 70 sharp teeth, as well as a second set of teeth in the palate, so that anything that crossed his path could not escape.
We don't know for sure, but it may have been a bit tongue-tied. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been cannibal.
He attacked everything that entered the water, even a giant dinosaur such as a T. rex was not a match for him.
However, the Romans consumed food that we know, but they ate strange or unusual dishes, such as deer, pheasants, snails and cockroaches, as well as the hare, a sort of rodent.
Another difference: while the poor and the woman ate their food sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to organize banquets where they rested on the side while they ate.
Roman meals of antiquity could not include these foods that were introduced into Europe centuries later. 
For example, they had no wheat, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no Romans have ever tasted pork.
Babylonians built temples for each of their gods, which were regarded as the dwellings of the god.
People sacrificed to the gods and priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had a courtyard, then a inner sanctum to which only priests could access.
Some pyramidal temples, the ziggurats, were sometimes built as part of a temple.
The summit of the tower was a special place for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
The majority of the Jewish family's life was spent in the open air.
Women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were only counters open to the street. The houses were built in stones. 
There were no great forests in Canaan, so the wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In Scandinavian sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and found Greenland — and named it — on his travels further west.
But regardless of her discovery, the Eskimo people already lived there in the time.
While each country is'scandinavian', there are many differences between the people, the kings, the customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie Benjamin Gates and the Treasure of the Templars, you may think that a treasure map has been drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, it is not true. Although there is an inscription on the back of the document, it is not a treasure card.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, you could read the words 'Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776'. The text is on the bottom of the document, reversed.
While nobody knows who wrote it, it is known that at an early stage of its existence, the great scroll (which measures approximately 29 inches three quarters on 24 inches) was rolled up. 
It is therefore likely that the rating was added simply as an label.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
She was ruled by French collaborators, who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupying power instead of fighting it.
On August 15, 1940, Allied troops landed in the south of France, an invasion called Operation "Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French Forces had liberated the south of France and were heading for Germany.
A civilisation is a unique culture shared by a large number of people who live and work in cooperation, a society.
The word 'civilization' derives from the Latin word 'civis', which means civil and which is related to the words Latin 'civis', which means citizen, and 'civitas', which means city or state and which also indicates, in some way, the size of the society to which it relates.
Cities-states are the pioneers of nations. A civilisational culture involves the transmission of knowledge on several generations, a durable cultural empreinte and an equitable distribution.
Minority cultures disappear often without leaving any historically relevant traces and are not recognised as genuine civilisations.
In the revolutionary war, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government — the Congress being its only component — under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress did not have the power to impose taxes and, as there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on the authorities of the state, often less cooperative, to enforce all its acts.
He did not have the power to derogate from tax laws or from customs duties between states.
The articles required unanimous consent of all Member States before they could be amended and Member States took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, with the German national team, the second most successful team in the world and they have won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
In popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, equestrian, rugby, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1.
Skiing is the most popular sport in the northern regions, Italians participating in international and Olympic events.
Japan has more than 7 000 islands, which makes it the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of the islands that make up its archipelago, Japan is often referred to as an 'archipelago'.
The first information about Taiwan dates back to the fifteenth century, while European sailors passing through the island referred to it as Ilha Formosa, or 'beautiful island'.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the south-west of Taiwan, introducing a transformation of traditional practices of rice production and employing Chinese workers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared them provinces of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after losing the first Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Treaty, by which it ceded Taiwan to Japan, which was then ruling the island until 1945.
The Inca citadel is made up of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the sun temple and the three-window room.
Most of the buildings surrounding the complex have been rebuilt to provide better views of their original appearance.
In 1976, thirty per cent of the Machu Picchu had been restored and this restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format of photographic film is 35 mm; it was the most common format of film used in the late analogue era.
It is still made today, but what is important is that its image format is inherited from the digital camera's sensor format.
The 35mm format is actually 36mm wide by 24mm high.
So, we say that the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by 12 to get the simplest of integer ratios) is 3:2.
Many common formats (APS family, for example) are equal to this aspect ratio or approach it closely.
The third-party rule, often abused and ridiculed, is a simple directive that stimulates dynamism while offering protection to the image.
He indicates that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example).
In this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, was called into question.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has linked European states together despite the differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power touched everybody, from the king to the roturier.
One of the most important Christian principles is that wealth should be used to relieve suffering and poverty, and that the church's money is there specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church was in Rome for more than 1000 years and this concentration of power and money has led many people to ask whether this doctrine was respected.
After the start of hostilities, Great Britain established a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategy has so far been effective, cutting off vital supplies, although this blockade has been violating international law generally accepted and codified by several international agreements of the last two centuries.
The United Kingdom mines international waters to prevent ships from venturing into entire areas of maritime jurisdiction, thereby representing a threat even to neutral ships.
As this tactic has elicited only a timid response, Germany expected a similar response to its submarine warfare without limits.
In the 20th century, most citizens and nations showed a preference for pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the nations wished to avoid that such a situation could ever happen again.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four hundred dollars in his name, a poem by Charles Batchelor and a recommendation letter from Thomas Edison to Thomas Alva Edison.
The ancient Chinese had a unique way of showing the different periods of China or each family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
There were also periods of instability in the provinces during the Three Kingdoms period. The most famous of these periods is the period of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty.
In these times, fierce battles have taken place between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms were one of the bloodiest periods in the history of Chinese ancient times. Thousands of people died in battle to sit on the throne of the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political repercussions such as the use of the metric system, the passing from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people and not to one leader.
As well, after the Revolution, the jobs were opened to all male candidates, enabling the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
It is the same for the army, because the ranking of the armies is no longer based on the class, but on the calibre.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class in other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions that transcended the scope of this worldly life. He was accustomed to frequenting a cave which became famous under the name of 'Hira' on the mountain of 'Noor' (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
 Situated at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find, even if we know that it exists. When we entered the cave, we were completely isolated. 
Up there, you can see nothing but clear skies and beautiful mountains surrounding you. From the inside of the cave, you can see nothing but very little of this universe.
The Great Pyramid of Gizeh is the only of the seven wonders that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third millennium BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many gigantic structures erected in honour of the Pharaohs who have died.
The Giza plateau, or "Giza necropolis", in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, contains several pyramids (the largest being the most imposing), several small tombs, many temples and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honour the Pharaoh Khéops, and many small pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honour his wives and family.
The symbol "push" looks like a V and the symbol "pull" looks like a staple or a square with a missing side.
The top means you must start by the tip and push the bow, and the bottom means you must start by the nock (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
A bow up produces a softer sound, while a bow down produces a louder sound.
Please do not forget to write your own marks on the pencil, but do not forget that the printed marks are for a musical reason, and that you should therefore generally respect them.
On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old), and the sister of the king, Madame Elisabeth, all terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and screamed threats against the king and the queen.
The king and queen were forced to open the windows of their carriages because of the crowd.
At some point, a crowd member brandished the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles before the terrified queen.
The American imperialist war expenditures in the Philippines have been paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial government to cover a large part of the expenses and interest of the American government's bonds issued by Wall Street banks.
Of course, the superprofits derived from prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people could constitute the fundamental benefits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context in which the order was created.
These events took place during the period generally considered to be the High Middle Ages – a period of European history that lasted from 1000 to 1300.
The Middle Ages Central preceded the High Middle Ages and followed by the Low Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, including the technological push or the technological imperative to a strict sense of the word, according to which the destiny of humanity is determined by a logical underpinning linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies.
Many interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: technological development itself is a process that transcends cultural and political influences, and technology has an impact on societies that are intrinsically conditioned rather than socially.
One might say that the automobile is necessarily a driver of road development.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a few cars, so new methods of production are developed to reduce the cost of ownership of a car.
Massive ownership of cars also leads to an increased incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the field of health care for treating body injuries.
Romanticism presented an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
Romantic theories say that geography has shaped people and, over time, customs and culture have developed in harmony with the places occupied by society. These, in harmony with the places occupied by society, are preferable to laws imposed arbitrarily.
In the same way that Paris is known as the capital of the fashion of the contemporary world, Constantinople was regarded as the capital of the medieval Europe.
His reputation as the centre of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until 1100 AD.
His status has declined over the twelfth century, mainly because the Crusaders returned with presents such as silk and spices, which the Byzantine markets could not compete with.
At this time, the title of capital of fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 13th centuries.
At the beginning, the dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture, east.
However, due to the slowness of communication means, Western modes could lag behind by 25-30 years.
In the Middle Ages, Western Europe developed its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time, following the crusades, was the use of buttons for closing clothing.
Subsistence farming is a form of agriculture practised to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
A subsistence agriculture is a simple system, often organic, using heirloom seeds from the region, combined with rotational farming or other techniques that are relatively simple to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers practised subsistence farming and it is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together people feeling neglected by social norms and sharing the same ideas which allows them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnic origin, class, location and / or sex of members.
The criteria that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
Subculture members often signal their membership by using distinctive styles, which include modes, maniérismes, and slang.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialisation is to draw on a few tragic cases of children who, by neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse, have not been socialised by adults during their childhood.
These children are considered to be "wild" or "savage". Some children were locked up by people (usually their own parents) ; in some cases, the abandonment of this child was due to the rejection of a severe intellectual or physical disability which afflicted the child.
Children who have been abandoned or fleeing from abuse can have suffered serious abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or escaped.
Others would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in the wild.
When they are raised entirely by non-human species, wild children display almost the same behaviours as those of the species that raised them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
Instead of teaching students how to learn, the project support goes further.
Support is not a method of learning but rather a means of helping learners who discover a new teaching method such as the use of a new programme or the beginning of a new project.
Supports can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but the little guy at Microsoft Office is also a form of support.
Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are intended to guide, explain and guide students through procedures that would have been too difficult to manage on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for very different reasons, from neglect to maltreatment, to extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, attentive and educational, but that is the case.
We perceive the family placement system as a safe zone for these children.
Our family placement system is supposed to provide safe, loving homes, stable education and reliable health care.
The placement in family homes is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were previously removed.
Internet combines mass communication elements and interpersonal communication elements.
The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approaches to usages and gratifications.
For example, 'learning' and'socialisation' are seen as major factors promoting Internet use (James et al., 1995).
'Personal involvement' and 'continuous relationships' have also been identified as being new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied the public reactions to Internet sites.
Video recording has led to great discoveries in the interpretation of facial expressions, i.e., facial expressions during a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect if a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, has indicated how people with brain damage are still able to assess the sincerity of the speech with accuracy.
He suggests that such human-animal interpretation abilities may be found in domestic dogs.
The research of the twentieth century has shown that there are two genetic reservoirs: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and the selection removes it from the reserve of expressed variations.
The segregation and recombination of the two basins alternate between the two basins at each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a non-human primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet its amino acid needs from the available plant resources.
In addition, a lack of response has serious consequences: growth disorders, malnutrition and ultimately, death.
The most accessible plant proteins would be those found in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult to digest for us, unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest and provide a large amount of proteins containing all essential amino acids.
In all fairness, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors have solved their 'protein problem' a little bit in the same way that chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentional waking during your sleep period and subsequently falling asleep for a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
It can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock, so that you can wake up without waking up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock during your sleep, it may be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other methods of biorhythmic timekeeping include drinking a lot of liquids before going to bed (particularly water or tea, reputed to be diuretics), which forces you to wake up to urinate.
The degree of peace within a person opposes to the degree of tension in his or her body and mind.
As the tension is low, the positive vitality present is positive. Each person has the opportunity to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been enriched by the mahayana path and by many Indian techniques of yoga.
In principle, the Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the universal love path.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (illumination energy) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The Tibetan center of meditation is the yoga of the deity. It is through visualization of different deities that the channels of energy are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of awakening is created.
The Germans were an enemy of common cause during the Second World War, which led to the cooperation between the USSR and the USA. At the end of the war, deep conflicts between their different systems, methods and cultures ended the entente between these two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies have become enemies and the Cold War has begun.
She would last for 40 years and see real battles, through substitute armies, on as many battlefields as in Africa, Afghanistan, Cuba and elsewhere.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defence was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian head-of-the-pike.
But these plans were obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800 000 Soviet troops arrived and created the Bieloruss-Ukrainian front after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, as well as other international treaties, be they bilateral or multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods through the oceans.
The work of the armed forces has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the capacity to move your people and your goods, while interfering with the ability of your enemy to move his people and his goods.
One of the most recent examples of this situation was the North Atlantic campaign during the Second World War. The Americans were trying to cross the Atlantic Ocean to send soldiers and equipment to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, using mainly U-Boats, tried to stop this trade.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Great Britain as it has done for the rest of Europe.
It seems that the sheep were domesticated for the first time about 10 000 years ago in the Zagros mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them close to them so that they could easily access milk, fur, skins and meat.
Domestic cattle were usually kept in herds that wandered on hills or other pastures, often cared for by shepherds who were most often children or adolescents, known as shepherds.
The 'wagonways' were built in England from the 15th century.
While the railway tracks were simply made of parallel planks of wood, they allowed horses to reach greater speeds and to carry heavier loads than on the slightly more accident-prone roads of the day.
The cross-ties were introduced early to keep the tracks in place. However, it was soon apparent that the tracks would be more effective if they were equipped with a steel band on top.
It has become a standard practice, but the iron has caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails were introduced.
The first means of locomotion was walking: humans began walking upright about two million years ago with the arrival of the Homo Erectus ("right-handed man").
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as usual.
There are bipedal specializations in fossils of Australopithecus from 4,2 to 3,9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs already seven million years ago.
We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even lobby in the hope of mitigating the sufferings to come.
In many cases, it is a symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not just want a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems and turn them off.
It is clear that the world has changed a lot thanks to the scientific and technological advances made by human beings, and that the problems have become more serious because of the overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
After its adoption by Congress on 4 July, a manuscript signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to a few blocks away, to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
In the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, today known as 'Dunlap Broadsides'.
The first reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the Independence Hall on July 8, 2006.
One of them was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who read it to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy reached London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap sheets that are known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript copy has not survived.
Many palaeontologists now believe that a dinosaur group survived and is still alive. They are called birds.
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly.
There are still many things about birds that look like dinosaurs.
They have scales on their backs and claws, they lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on information manipulation that is encoded in binary form.
A binary number can only have one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary numbers, or bits to use the computer jargon.
An internal poisoning can not be seen immediately. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are sufficiently general to allow a diagnosis to be made immediately.
The best indicator of internal poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of toxic household drugs or chemicals.
Read the label for specific first aid instructions for this poison.
The term 'insect' is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from an old familiarity with bed bugs, which are very adapted to parasitizing humans.
Snails, like bed bugs, are nidicolous, that is, they are adapted to live in the nest or host's habitat.
In the United States, there are about 400 000 known cases of MS, making it the most common neurological disease in the young and middle-aged.
MS is a central nervous system disease that affects the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A couple can very well feel that it is not in their interest, nor in the child's interest, to look after the child's education.
These couples can choose to adopt their baby.
In the context of adoption, biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main objective of science is to understand how the world works through scientific methodology. This method guides in fact most scientific research.
However, it is not the only, experimentation, and an experiment is a test that serves to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, pose questions and make observations, but it also orients the scientific research.
Naturalist and philosophers have concentrated on ancient texts, and in particular on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's opinions on all scientific questions, including psychology, were accepted.
With the decline of Greek knowledge, Western civilization has been cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behaviour depend to a great extent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which do not simply represent responses to periodic stimuli external to living beings, have been documented for most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
The biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to operate for a certain period even when external stimulation is absent.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the major indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacteria.
They have conducted two experiments to mark either the DNA of the phage with a radioactive phosphorus, or the protein of the phage with a radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the extent of the mutated gene, and whether the mutated cells are germ cells.
Only the germline mutations can be passed on to children, while other mutations can lead to cancer or death of cells.
Ecotourism is aimed at people who want to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, including flora and fauna.
Hunting, fishing, bird watching, visiting parks and studying information on the ecosystem are examples of activities on the ground.
You can, for example, go to see, photograph, and discover the orang-utans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small towns in the countryside by car to get to their place of work and cross other people who are going to work in the country they just left.
In this dynamic transport system, everyone is connected to a private car-based transport system and supports it.
Now science has shown that this massively carbon-based economy has pushed the biosphere out of its stable state that supported human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about the quality of water or bridge collapses.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints, why are they down all the time? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
The traffic flow is the study of the movements of drivers and private vehicles between two points, and the interactions they exercise between them.
It is difficult to predict the flow of traffic because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with 100 per cent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act within a reasonable range; so, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically approximatively.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) the flow, (2) the density and (3) the speed.
These relationships help to plan, design and operate road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly enabled them to escape more easily from their enemies and to find more effectively food and companions.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their bodies.
It gives them more small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and transient.
There are some 4,000 years ago, a man called Aristotle said that the solar system moves around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many thought the opposite: that the solar system moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
It seems reasonable, because the Earth does not feel like it is moving, is that not?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the second largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times the volume of water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the largest river in the world, reaching up to 10 km wide.
At least 20 % of the water that falls from rivers in the world into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main branch of the Amazon River is 6 387 km (3 980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of small rivers.
While the construction of pyramids continued up to the end of the Old Kingdom, the Great Pyramid of Gizeh never surpassed its size and the quality of its construction.
Ancient Egyptians were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, who had then been in existence for more than a thousand years.
Vatican City has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and the least populated.
The Vatican's official language is Italian.
The Italian language is also the everyday language used by most of the people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
The citizens of the Vatican City are all Catholics.
From the beginning of time, people have been familiar with basic elements such as gold, silver and copper, because they are found in nature as raw materials and are relatively simple to mine using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, has theorised that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. It was earth, water, air and fire.
It was more about the four states of matter (in the same order) : solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although he also made the case that these latter would also transform into new substances to form what we see.
Aluminium alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered as metals. Of course, there are also metals such as gold and silver.
There are also alloys that contain a small quantity of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of minuscule particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could enter the period at the end of this sentence.
So, the pencil was a good friend for many people when it was released.
Unfortunately, the appearance of new writing styles has marginalized the pen to a more private status and to less frequent uses.
People are now writing messages on computer screens, without ever having to touch a pencil.
We can only wonder what the keyboard will become when the next new thing comes along.
Nuclear fission works on the principle that it combines the energy of a myriad of protons and neutrons into a single nucleus.
A bit like trying to climb a hill by dragging a heavy cart up a hillside. Dividing the core again, and then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, so they tend to break up with little or no pressure.
The moon's surface is made up of rocks and dust. Its outer layer is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the visible side and 100 km on the hidden side.
It is thinner at sea level and thicker under continents.
There may be more lava on the side close to the volcano because the magma is thinner.
Content theories are focused on the search for what makes people feel good or attracted.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they matured into adulthood.
These theories examine what prompts some people to want what they do and what, in their environment, prompts them to do or not do what they do.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviours can emerge when a manager becomes the boss of former colleagues. From the extreme end of the spectrum being to try to stay "the good friend" (or "the good friend").
This type of manager has a hard time taking unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary actions, carrying out evaluations, delegating responsibilities, and holding others accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes a person who is completely unrecognizable, who feels that he/she must change everything that the group has created up to now and do things in his/her own way
After all, the boss is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behaviour often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical team.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet at different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a real "invisible" team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also an unique element of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the team of management to which each member reports. It sets standards for each of them.
Why would an organisation want to create a structure for learning? One of the objectives of applying organisational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently in the functional services of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can be expressed fully.
That means that a process of working together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new process that is innovative to meet the customer's need.
Before an organisation can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and its own learning culture.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organisations achieve better results.
Neurobiological data provide material evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research. They allow therefore to reduce the research field and make it much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research.
We have known for a long time that different types of damage, lesions, tumours and cerebral trauma affect the behaviour and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
It gives us a lot of information and material to build models of simulation that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although Artificial Intelligence is often heavily connoted with science-fiction, it is a very important part of computer science that studies the behaviour, learning and adapting intelligently of a machine.
The field of artificial intelligence is concerned with the automating of tasks requiring an intelligent approach.
In addition to the examples mentioned above, there are the control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnostics and customer questions, as well as recognition of writing, voice and face.
This practice has led to distinct disciplines, focused on providing solutions to the everyday problems of life.
The system of artificial intelligence is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and military, as it was put into practice in several home computer software and video games.
Excursions are an integral part of any school. Often, a teacher would like to take his pupils to places where a bus trip is not possible.
The solution is provided by the technology in the form of educational virtual tours. The students can view the ancient artifacts of a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a beautiful work of art while sitting in their class.
Participating practically to a trip is also a good way to think about a trip and to share your experiences with future generations.
For example, students at Bennett High School in North Carolina design each year a website dedicated to their visit to the capital of the state. Each year the site is updated, but the old versions are kept online for use as an album.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Even if students often try the blog with poor grammar and spelling, having a public makes it easier to improve.
As students are often the most critical of the blog's content, the author is trying to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging "forces students to be smart and interesting." The need to draw public attention encourages students to be intelligent and interesting.
Blogs are an important tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning well beyond the traditional school day.
When used properly, blogs can help students to strengthen their analytical and critical thinking skills: by responding actively to online content, they can confront their own opinions with those of others and expose their own views on specific topics.
Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada and has a large number of art galleries and museums that highlight the past and present of Canada.
You will find further south the falls of Niagara and further north, the Muskoka region and its environs which have a virgin natural beauty.
All these measures, and many more, make Ontario what foreigners regard as the quintessence of Canada.
A large part of the northern areas are not very populated and some are almost uninhabited in the wild.
For a comparison of the population that surprises more than one: There are more African-Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean, close to the African coast.
Madagascar is the largest country, and even a continent by itself, in terms of animal life.
Most of the small islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known for being luxury beach resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam to the islands and this religion has spread widely to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European and colonial influence began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route linking Europe to India.
North is defined by the Sahara Desert and south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
To women: It is recommended that any woman who travels say that she is married, regardless of her marital status.
It is also advised to wear an engagement ring (which should not seem too precious.)
Women must realise that some cultural differences may lead to behaviours they regard as harassment. It is common that they are followed, caught by the arm, etc.
Be firm in your refusal of advances from men, and do not be afraid to stand your ground (cultural or otherwise, it does not mean that it is acceptable!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Ptolemies, the Romans and the Medes as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese who had destroyed it had rebuilt it and renamed it Casa Branca, but it was abandoned in 1755 after a major earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name of Daru l-Badya, and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in all of Morocco for shopping.
Around the old medina, you can easily find traditional Moroccan products, such as tajines, pottery, leather goods, nargilis and all kinds of bibelots, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located at the extreme east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano which buried most of the city, especially the town centre.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside Goma should be subject to thorough investigation to understand the state of the fighting in the province of North-Kivu.
The city is also the starting point for the eruption of Nyiragongo volcano as well as for the gorilla tracking treks in the least expensive part of Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motor taxi) to get around in Goma. The normal price (local) is about 500 CFA francs for a small trip.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Tombouctou" has become a metaphor for remote and exotic countries.
Today, Tombouctou is a poor city, although its reputation as a tourist attraction makes it a popular destination, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the World Heritage List at risk, due to the threat of desert sands.
This was one of the main steps in the series "Wonders of the African World" on the PBS.
The city contrasts strongly with the rest of the country, because it has a more Arab style than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the border with South Africa is the Crocodile River
The total area of the park is 19 500 km2, divided into 14 ecozones, each of which contains a specific fauna.
This is one of the most famous South African National Parks and considered as the jewel of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As for all South African national parks, there are daily entry fees and conservation fees.
It may be advantageous to obtain a Wild Card that enables access to certain South African national parks, as well as all South African national parks.
The name of Hong Kong Island is derived from the name of the territory of Hong Kong and represents the main attraction for many tourists.
The row of buildings that forms the horizon of Hong Kong was compared to a shimmering bar chart, which is revealed by reflection in the harbour of Victoria.
To admire the most beautiful panoramas of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to Kowloon's front beach located in front.
The majority of the urban development of Hong Kong is concentrated on the north-western terraces.
This is the place that the British colonists have invested. Thus, this seems to be a good starting point, if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this region.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest mangrove forest belt, extending for 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the backcountry of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a world heritage site by UNESCO. The forest area in India is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not only composed of mangrove swamps: they also contain some of the last vestiges of the majestic jungles that covered the plains of the Ganges once.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3 850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water/wetlands.
Sundarbans is a nature reserve since 1966, you will find about 400 Bengal tigers and 30 000 striped hyenas.
Buses leave the district bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, but most, especially those that serve the east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6 am and 7 am.
Bus inter-districts are often full, so it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese ships, which are comfortable and robust.
Taxi colectivos are a fast and comfortable way to get to places near, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock Bridge is a suspension bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to link the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint George's-de-l'Oyapock in Guyana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 metres; it is 378 metres long and has two 3,50m wide lanes.
The vertical displacement under the bridge is 15 metres. The structure was completed in August 2011, but it was opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge should be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs posts will be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group living in what is now the eastern part of Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and subsistence farmers.
Other tribes of the Chaco, such as the Guaycurú or the Payaguá, lived mainly on fishing, hunting, or gathering.
In 1516, Paraguay was called the 'giant province of India', the result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and the indigenous populations.
The Spanish inaugurated the period of colonization, which lasted three centuries.
From the foundation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain a large part of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best teams and among the best players in polo in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
In addition, smaller tournaments and matches are sometimes organised here at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and places to buy tickets for polo matches, see the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Isle of Man is the Manx pound (FKP) which is equivalent to a pound sterling (GBP).
The money can be exchanged at the only bank in Stanley, on the island of Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
The pound sterling is a widely accepted currency in the islands, while at Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the nearby islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, even if it is possible that the British and American dollars will be accepted. Talk to the owners in advance to agree on a payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange money from the Maldives outside the islands, so change it before you leave the islands.
Montevideo being located in the south of the Equator, the winter in the northern hemisphere corresponds to the summer there and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a tropical zone and summer temperatures exceeding 30° Celsius are common.
Winter can be misleadingly cold: the temperatures rarely fall below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to give the impression that it is colder than what the thermometer says.
There is no real season of ‘rainy’ and ‘dry’: the precipitation is pretty constant all year round.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, they are wild animals and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the authorities of the park, you must stay at least 100 metres away from wolves and bears and at least 25 metres away from all other wild animals!
As placid as they may appear, deer, elk, moose, and almost all the great animals can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they did not keep a sufficient distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them some space.
In addition, know that odors attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid transporting or cooking food that smells and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a little less than 40 000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and is the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a naval tragedy in 1889 when seven German, US and British ships refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
The Supreme Head of State Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was assassinated during a peaceful rally held in the city during the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement.
The beaches are numerous, because Auckland is situated at the crossroads of two harbours. The most popular beaches are found in three zones.
The North Shore beaches are on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay north to Devonport south.
Most of the beaches are sandy and allow safe swimming, and most are shaded by Pohutukawa trees.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are on the Waitemata Harbour, in the chic suburb of Mission Bay and in the centre of Auckland.
These beaches, sometimes very frequented by families, have many shops along the coast. Swimming is safe there.
The main local beer is the "Number One", a rather ordinary beer, but tasty and refreshing. There is also another local beer, the "Manta".
There are many French wines to taste, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may travel better.
You can drink the water from the local tap without any danger, but you can easily find bottled water if you have any concerns about it.
For Australians, the idea of a "cream coffee" is foreign. A black coffee is an "espresso", the cappuccino is filled with cream (not foam) and the tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is Belgian standard. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries due to one of these causes on the reef are rare.
However, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signs and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
From October to April, north of 1770, the box jellyfish arrive near the beaches and estuaries of rivers. They can also sometimes be seen outside of this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most of them are afraid of humans and would run away.
Salmon crocodiles do not live in the ocean, their main habitat is in estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveller the peace of mind that he will have somewhere to sleep once he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but you can also book through travel agencies of other types of accommodation, such as camping sites.
Travel agencies usually offer packages including breakfast, airport transfers or even packages combining flights and accommodation.
They can also hold your booking if you need time to think about the offer or to procure other documents necessary for your destination (for example, a visa).
Any change or request must be addressed first to the travel agency and not directly to the hotel.
In some music festivals, most participants decide to camp on site, and most consider that this is an integral part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the music event, you will have to arrive early to find a good camping site.
Don't forget that even if the concerts are over on the main stages, other concerts can continue until late at night on other sites of the festival.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the north of the Baltic Sea in winter, be sure to check the location of the hut, as the ice breaking up can cause unbearable noises at the most exposed huts.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time spent in the city. Passengers on cruises are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos generally make many efforts to maximise the time and money spent by customers. There are rarely windows and clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer special offers of food, drinks and entertainment to keep the guests happy and to keep them there.
On some sites, it is the locals who offer free alcoholic beverages. However, drunkenness impairs judgement, and all good players should know that it is crucial to remain sober.
Anyone who travels to high latitudes or crosses mountains must consider the possibility of snow, ice or cold temperatures.
On the icy roads and snowy roads, the friction is low and you can't drive like you were on the pavement.
In the blizzards, it can fall in a very short time enough snow to block you.
Visibility can also be limited by snow or ice or by condensation or frost on the windows of vehicles.
In addition, the presence of ice and snow is normal in many countries, and traffic is practically continuous all year round.
Safaris are perhaps the most popular tourist attraction in Africa and the most memorable moment for many visitors.
In everyday language, the term'safari' refers to an excursion on the African continent, and in particular to the savannah, having the purpose of witnessing the spectacular spectacle of wild animals in their natural environment.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach close to cars and standard equipment allows them to be observed.
Lion, leopard and lion-tailed cats are sometimes shy and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as 'walking in the bush', 'walking safari' or 'footing') consists of walking, either for a few hours, or for several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will take place in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympic Games, after hosting the Games in 1964.
If you have booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the delay, you will be facing a difficult situation.
The cancellations policies vary, but from mid-March, most cancellations policies based on the coronavirus do not extend to July 2020, the date the Olympic Games were to be held.
We expect most events tickets to cost between 2 500 and 130 000 yens, typical tickets costing about 7 000 yens.
While ironing wet clothes, you can make them dry more quickly. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards which can be borrowed, even if there aren't in the rooms. 
If you don't have a iron or if you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if you find one.
Avoid leaving the fabric too hot (which can cause it to shrink or in extreme cases, to burn).
There are different methods of water purification, including some that are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it is enough to boil the water for a minute; in others, it is necessary to boil it for several minutes. 
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you have a problem, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter unfamiliar animals that they do not know in their home region.
Parasites can contaminate food, cause irritations or, in the most serious cases, cause allergic reactions, spread venom or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can wound or kill people by force, are not usually regarded as parasites.
In some areas, tax-free shops present an opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and duties.
Travellers to countries where taxes are high can sometimes make substantial savings, particularly on alcoholic beverages or tobacco. 
The Buffalo-Pittsburgh section of the highway is the most difficult on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, passing through isolated backcountry areas from the rear.
If you have not driven on country roads before, keep your eyes open: the steep hills, narrow roads and tight curves are prevalent.
Speed limits are lowered significantly compared with previous sections and the stricter they are, the more important it is to obey them.
On the other hand, the mobile phone service is surprisingly much stronger here than on many other parts of the road, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cakes are rather good, and in Bavaria, they are very rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbour, Austria.
Fruit cakes are a common feature of the season: apples are baked and baked all year round, while pears and plums are in season in the summer.

A curry dish can be "solid" or "liquid" depending on the amount of sauce it contains. 
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in the south of India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesia having 17 000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines present in all of the country.
However, when this term is used without any other qualification, it tends to designate the food from the central and eastern parts of the island of Java.
Now, widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a range of simple dishes, the predominant flavours being coconut, peppers, sugar (especially coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are the feet of the rider, which hang from each side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability to the user, but they can pose a security problem: in fact, the user's feet can get stuck there.
If a rider is thrown from a horse, but has one foot caught in the stirrup, he could be dragged if the horse escapes. To minimise this risk, a number of measures of safety can be taken.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a flat sole and a smooth, narrow sole.
Then, some stools, in particular English stools, have safety bars which allow a rider to fall off the saddle if the rider is pulled back by a falling rider.
Valle de Cochamó – The destination of excellence for rock climbing in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with many different granite faces and cliffs.
From the top of the mountains, the panoramas are spectacular. The alpinists throughout the world are discovering new paths practicable on the slopes, where the possibilities are endless. 
Skiing and snowboarding are popular winter sports that involve sliding down a snowy slope with skis or snowboards attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity that has many fans, sometimes called'ski bums', who organise their entire vacations around skiing in specific places.
The idea of skiing is very ancient: some prehistoric paintings show skiers dating for some time to the 5 000 years ago.
Skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 16th century; the first ski club in Australia was founded in 1861 by Norwegians. 
Skiing: this activity is also called Nordic skiing, cross-country skiing or hiking.
It resembles alpine skiing, as well as alpine climbing, but does not include these activities, which are practiced on rugged terrain and require the use of skis and boots much stiffer. 
Think of skiing as a similar hiking route.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover a little more distance than on foot – but you will never reach the speeds of skiing without a heavy pack on a muddy slope.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but containing many independent countries. In classic circumstances, travelling through several countries involves several visa applications and several passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, works a little like one country in this regard.
 " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " 
In addition, having a Schengen visa means you do not need to apply separately for each member state of the Schengen area, which saves time, money and administrative procedures.
There is no universal definition of an antique object that can be used to determine whether an object is an antique. Some tax authorities define objects over 100 years as antiquities.
The criteria vary according to where one is located; in some parts of the world, such as North America, the age limit can be lower than that in force in Europe.
Artisanal products can be regarded as antiques even if they are less ancient than similar industrial products.
Ranging of reindeer is an important means of subsistence for the Samis and the culture surrounding this trade is of great importance to many other professions.
Although, according to tradition, all Samis have not been involved in large-scale reindeer farming, they lived mainly from fishing, hunting and other similar activities, and used reindeer mainly as livestock.
Today, many Samis practice modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Lapland, the Sami region.
While widely used, especially among non-Roma people, the term 'Gitan' is often considered to be pejorative because of its association with negative stereotypes and an unfair image of the Roma people.
If your country is subject to a travel warning issued by your government, your overseas health insurance or travel insurance may be affected.
You can also consult other governments’ advice, but their advice is tailored to their citizens.
As an example, American citizens in the Middle East could be confronted with different situations from those of Europeans or Arabs.
The opinions are only a brief summary of the political situation of a country.
The opinions presented are often superficial, general and too simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Violent weather is the generic term for all dangerous weather phenomena that can cause damage, social disruption or loss of life.
Very adverse weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and they can be of several kinds, according to the geographical, topographical and meteorological characteristics.
Violent winds, hail, excessive rainfall and fires are forms and effects of violent weather, just as tornadoes, hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones.
Extreme weather phenomena, regional and seasonal, include cold winter storms, snowstorms with violent winds, and sandstorms or dust storms.
It is strongly recommended that travellers check the weather forecast for their destination region, knowing that it can have a significant impact on their travel plans.
Anyone considering going to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
A search on the Internet for "Hostile Environment Courses" will probably lead to the address of a local company.
A course will cover the topics covered in this way in much more detail, usually with a practical experience.
A training usually lasts for 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, first aid, and sometimes gun training.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wild are common, but those dealing with war zones are very few.
Travellers planning to undergo a gender reassignment abroad should be sure to have valid travel documents for their return journey.
The desire of governments to issue passports with the sex not indicated (X) or to update documents to correspond to the desired name and sex varies.
The foreign governments' willingness to honour these documents is also variable.
The security checkpoint searches have become much more intrusive in the era of post-11 September 2001.
Transsexual people in the pre-op phase should not expect to be scanned in order to preserve their privacy and dignity.
Storm surges are the surges that return from the waves that break on the beach, often on a reef or equivalent.
Because of the underwater topography, the return flow is concentrated on a few deeper sections, and a fast current can form in the deep waters.
The deaths are caused by exhaustion that results from attempting to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
When you leave the current, the return to swimming is not more difficult than usual.
You may want to aim for a place where you will not be caught again. It is also possible that depending on your skills and whether you have been spotted or not, you may want to wait for help.
The adjustment shock occurs earlier than the cultural shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travellers who have had difficulty adjusting to the new culture have sometimes a lot of difficulty adjusting to their home culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and have lost some of your old culture.
At first, when you went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country must adapt.
People may not be anticipating that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers and travelers returning home.
The light and sound show at the Pyramid is one of the most interesting attractions for children in the region.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
Often, you hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The history of sound and light is like a history book.
The Sphinx is the backdrop and the narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and the different pyramids are lit.
The Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the largest number of research stations and six are active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the mainland. The island of King George, with the village of Villa Las Estrellas, is the largest.
Other examples: Livingston Island and the disappointment caldera, where the still active volcano's inland sea offers a spectacular natural harbour.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula sink into the plateau, then reappear to form the Ellsworth Mountains, which are 360 km long and traversed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, contains the highest mountains of the Antarctic, the Vinson Massif, which rises to 4892 m.
In remote areas, without cellular telephony, you may have no other choice but to rely on satellite telephony.
A satellite phone does not replace a mobile phone, because you need to be outside and have a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
This is a service often used for navigation, including boats, as well as expeditions that require data transmission and telephony.
Your local telephone operator should be able to tell you more about the connection to this service.
Those who plan a year off have the opportunity to learn while traveling, and more and more of them choose this option.
This formula is particularly popular among young people who leave school, because it allows them to take a year off before university, without jeopardising their studies.
Often, having taken a year off to study abroad can actually give you better chances of going to college in your home country.
In general, you have to pay tuition fees for these educational programs.
Finland is a popular destination for sailing. The "Land of the thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, in lakes and in archipelagoes.
You do not necessarily need a yacht in the archipelagoes and lakes.
While the coastal and major lakes are actually quite large for a boat, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Recreational boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for seven or eight people.
The Netherlands, Sweden and New Zealand are in the same situation, but apart from that, it is a unique case (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one to forty).
Most cruises on the Baltic Sea are characterised by a prolonged stay in St. Petersburg, in Russia.

If you do not travel by airplane to the ground, you do not need a separate visa (from 2009).
Berlin, in Germany, is mentioned in some brochures for cruises. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not at all located near the sea and no visit to this city is included in the cruise price. 
Traveling by air can be a terrifying experience for all ages and all horizons, in particular if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It is not shameful to admit that it is not different from fears and fears of personal things that many people have.
For some, understanding something about the operation of aircraft and what is going on during a flight can help to overcome an unknown fear or the feeling of not having control.
Transport companies are well paid to deliver fast. Often, in an urgent repair, the question of time is crucial for documents, goods or spare parts that relate to it.
On some roads, big companies have their own planes, but on other roads and for small businesses, there was a problem.
If they had sent goods by airfreight, on some routes, it would have taken days to clear customs and to unload the goods.
The only way to do it was to send it as registered baggage. The airline regulations will not allow them to send a bag without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The easiest way to travel in first class or business class is to pay a large sum of money for this privilege (or, better still, ask your company to do it for you).
However, it is not cheap: generally, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal fare for economy class, and eleven times for first class!
Generally, it is pointless to try to get discounts for business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines know very well that they can count on a certain type of passenger who are willing to pay very high prices for the privileges of speed and comfort, and they set their prices accordingly.
The capital of the Republic of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is very common.
The Republic of Moldova is a multiethnic republic that is suffering from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict resulted in the creation of the proclaimed republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, with its own government and its own currency, but recognized by no Member State of the United Nations.
The economic links have been restored between these two parts of the Moldavie despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
With a population of 3,7 million, İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey, the second port after Istanbul, and a good platform for correspondence.
The ancient city of Smyrna is today a modern commercial centre, developed and vibrant, located around an enormous bay, surrounded by mountains.

Don't forget that you are visiting a mass grave, as well as a site that has a very important meaning for a large part of the world's population.
There are still many women and men alive who survived their stay here, and many others who saw their loved ones murdered or killed by forced labour, Jews or non-Jews in any case.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Don't make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Don't destroy the site by defacing or scratching graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the residents prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and almost everyone is able to speak Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, because the law establishes that it is the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other installations.
Regular announcements in the underground are made only in Catalan, but disruptions unforeseen are announced by an automatic system in many languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
The Parisians have a reputation for being egocentric, rude and arrogant.
While this stereotype is often inaccurate, the best way to get along in Paris is to behave in a manner that is polite and courteous. This will make your travels much easier.
The abrupt exteriors of Parisians evaporate quickly if you show a minimum of courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely wooded, mainly of beech, pine and oak, and presents a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
The country has a great variety of plant communities due to the diversity of its microclimates, soils and altitudes.

Among the rarer species, the European brown bear, the wolf, the owl, the lynx, the bobcat, and the great tit can be seen, as well as many common species.
When they visit a monastery, women must cover their knees and cover their shoulders as well.
Most monasteries provide women with shawls, but if you bring your own shawl, and if it is brightly coloured, you will be given a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
As well as men must wear trousers covering the knees.
You can also borrow this dress from the rack at the entrance, but as it is not washed after each use, it might not feel comfortable to wear these skirts. A size-one for men!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar Mediterranean regions, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and relies on olive oil.

It can also be said that it facilitates reading, though writing is somewhat complicated by the need to know whether a verb or an adjective is used in a substantive form.
The pronunciation is fairly easy in Italian, because most of the words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to watch are the c and the g, because their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Please also ensure that you pronounce 'r' and 'rr' in a distinct way: 'caro' means 'dear', while 'carro' means 'cart'.
Persian has a relatively easy grammar and most of the time regular.
In other words, this introduction to Persian grammar would help you to better understand Persian grammar and to better understand the phrases.
It goes without saying that if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, those who speak a little Spanish might conclude hastily that the Portuguese is sufficiently close to Spanish to not need to study it separately.
Premodern observatories are generally outdated today, and remain as museums or educational sites.
As pollution from light at that time was not as serious as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, easier to access than those built in the modern era.
Modern research telescopes are enormous infrastructures placed in remote regions where the weather conditions are favourable.
Hanami, the Japanese tradition of viewing the cherry blossoms, is a part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept came from China where plum blossoms were the favorite flower.
In Japan, the first Cherry Blossom Festival was held by Emperor only for himself and his closest aristocratic circle around the Imperial Court.
Plants are most beautiful when they are in an essentially natural state, resist the temptation to take just one.

Many traditions associated with these holidays have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-believers around the world.
It is customary to stay awake at dawn to see the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be that it is a spring and fertility ritual pre-Christian.
Traditional churches often hold a midnight Easter vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, with the congregations often breaking into the celebration at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All animals that arrived on these islands originated by water, swimming or by air.
Because of the great distance between the continent and the animals, the giant tortoise was the main animal of pasture for the Galapagos Islands.
From the arrival of man to the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including cattle, horses, cows, sheep, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will be able to witness the polar night, during which the sun does not rise above the horizon.
It is a good opportunity to admire the auroras borealis, because the sky will be dark practically all the day.
As the regions are sparsely populated, and pollution from light is not a problem, you can also enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than that which Westerners are used to.
Costumes are classic workwear, and employees are called by their family name or by their job title.
Workplace harmony is crucial, because it places the emphasis on collective effort rather than on individual achievements.
