This confirms not only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides details that fossils in general cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
The scientists say that the fur of this animal was on the top dark brown and on the bottom light- or carotinoid-coloured.
The find also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well developed sheath called the quill, but other characteristics of feathers – hooks and barbules – the researchers concluded that the quill must have been an evolutionary development later than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not intended for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or for heart function.
The scientists claimed that, despite this being the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample showed the fur of an adult and not of a young dino.

Martelly has just appointed a provisional electoral commission (CEP) with nine members.
It is his fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a Presidential Commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of the package of measures to steer the country towards new elections.
The Commission was the response to the widespread regime-critical protests that began in October.
The trigger for the violent protests was the failure to hold elections, some of which have been due since 2011.
A total of 60 cases of overheating of iPods have been reported. In total, six fires have been set and four people have suffered minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that it had 27 accidents in connection with the devices.
Last week, the METI announced that it had received 34 additional instances of overheating from Apple which it described as "not serious
The Ministry responded by describing the postponement of the report by Apple as "really unfortunate.

Liggins followed in the footsteps of his father and became a medical doctor.
He was a trained obstetrician and took up his work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working in the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature contractions in his spare time.
His research showed that the application of a hormone accelerated the lung development of the fetus.
Xinhua reported that investigators from the government have recovered two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Ringer colleagues paid tribute to Luna as well.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of extremes. My first manager. Luna died in the night of the two moons. Very unique, exactly like she. A strong woman.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels gave the following comment: "Luna was just as crazy as I was... maybe even crazier... I love her and I will miss her... hopefully she is in a better place.
From the 1 400 people who were questioned in the run-up to the 2010 federal elections, the proportion of those who oppose Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The current acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the election campaign for the federal election in 2010, that her opinion was that Australia would end its monarchy and become a republic at the end of her reign.
34 percent of those surveyed share this view and want that Elizabeth II is the last Australian monarch.
29 percent of the respondents said that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent said that Australia should never become a republic.
The gold medal winner at the Olympic Games should swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three-person relays at the Commonwealth Games, but because of his many complaints his fitness was doubted.
He was not in a position to take the necessary drugs to alleviate his pain, as they are banned at the Commonwealth Games.
On 25 January, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Many people confirmed the discovery via different hardware and software on February 1st and on Tuesday it was announced.
Cosmic rays may have been a source of water supply for the Earth, together with organic matter which forms proteins and allows life to occur.
Because comets collided with the Earth many years ago, scientists are hoping to gain insight into how planets, in particular the Earth, are formed.
Cuomo (53) took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumours as 'political nonsense' and 'childishness'.
There is speculation that he may be running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system claimed by the FAA that would allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology rather than the older technology based on ground radar to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
There will be no additional trains, no new stations, and the underground trains will not stop in Wembley. There are no parking spaces or parking-and-ride facilities available there.
With the fear of transport problems growing, the likelihood that the game would be played behind closed doors grew.
A study published on Thursday in Science reported the emergence of a new bird species on the Galápagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and at Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new form of the species had developed within just two generations, despite the fact that it had previously been assumed that this process would take much longer due to the mating between an indigenous Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant Kaktus finch, Geospiza
Gold can be processed into various forms. It can be rolled into tiny forms.
It can be drawn into a thin thread, which can be twisted and woven into a leaf.
It can be made very thin and glued to another metal. It can be so thin that it sometimes was used to decorate handwritten pictures, called pictures, called pictures handwritten.
This is what is known as the PH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator with red vinegar.
The ash changes its color depending on whether the chemical is acidic or basic.
The pH level points to the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemicals.
Protons are electrons that have been removed from water molecules (because water molecules consist of a proton and an electron)." #
Mix the two powders together and then form them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a protective layer.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had almost every house equipped with a flush toilet, which was connected to a
Remains of sewage systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia and China, there were toilets. In Roman culture, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses which men and women visited together.
If you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it almost immediately back down.
The satellite was launched by a rocket into space. Scientists use telescopes in space, because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and our view.
It is necessary to launch a giant rocket with a height of more than 100 feet to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in a way that is unbelievable. The greatest service the wheel has given us is much easier and faster transportation.
It has brought us the railway, the car and many other modes of transport.
In addition to the larger cats, there are medium-sized cats that eat prey of all sizes, from rabbits to elephants and rhinos.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-roaming house cats) that eat much smaller prey animals such as insects, rodents, frogs and birds
The secret of their success is the niche concept, a special task that every cat has and that ensures that they do not compete with other cats.
Lions are the most social cats. They live in large groups, which are called clans.
The herds consist of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and young males.
Women generally have a close relationship with each other when they live in a large family with sisters and daughters.
Lions act in a similar way to wolves or dogs, animals that resemble lions but are not as dangerous to their prey as they are to other large cats.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (if not particularly well), swim, long distance jump and with the fivefold power of a strong person pull.
The tiger is in the same group (species) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the roar of the lion, but more like a sentence of gruff grumbling words.
Ozelots eat small animals. If they can, they will steal monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all animals that the ozelot hunts are much smaller than he is.
Scientists think that otters track prey with their sense of smell and find it by sniffing it. They sniff it, where they have been lying down.
They can see in the dark very well and move unseen. Ocelot hunters stalk their prey by matching their environment and then attacking.
If a small group of animals (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it comes (for example, if they move over a mountain range or a river or if they migrate to a new island, so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they did previously.
This new environment has other resources and other competitors, so that the new population needs to have other characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor than what it used to need.
The original population has not changed at all. it still needs the same adaptations as before.
As time goes by, the new population adapts to their new environment, and then they look less and less like the other population.
After tens of thousands or even millions of years, two populations will then look so different that they will no longer be considered to be of the same species.
This process is called specialization, which simply means the emergence of new species. It is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants generate oxygen, which people breathe in, and they take carbon dioxide out of the air, which people exhale (which means, breathe out).

We build our houses out of plants and make clothing out of plants. We eat mainly plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the largest predator of its time, so he feared nothing but other Mosasaurs.
His long jaws were equipped with more than 70 sharp teeth, including a second set on the tongue, which meant that there was no escape for any animal that crossed its path.
We do not know for sure, but he may have had a hooked tongue. He ate fish, large reptiles, other Mosasaurs, and maybe even a cannibal.
He took everything that came into the water; even a great dinosaur like the T. Rex was not up to the task.
While most of their food is known to us, the Romans had a taste for strange or unusual meals, including wild boar, peacock, snails and a kind of insect called the seven-headed slug.
Another difference was that the poor people and women ate their food on chairs. The rich men preferred to hold banquets where they sat on the side, while they ate their meals.
The Roman courts could not contain food that had come from America or Asia in later centuries.
They had neither corn nor tomatoes nor potatoes nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever ate a goat.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a temple which was regarded as his house.
Man offered sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to comply with the will of the gods.
Every temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner altar chamber, which was only accessible to priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped temples, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses did not have such a great importance.
The majority of the life of the Hebrew family was played out under the open sky.
The women cooked in the yard. Businesses simply consisted of open shop windows. To build a house, stone was used.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so that wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the old Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled for murder from Iceland. When he travelled further west, he found Greenland and gave it the name Greenland.
But, whatever his discovery, Eskimo tribes lived there already at that time.
Although all the countries were "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the film 'The Templer's Legacy', you may think that on the reverse of the Declaration of Independence there was a treasure map drawn.
That is not true. Although on the back of the document there is written something, it is not a treasure map.
The declaration of independence was written on the reverse side, with the words "original declaration of independence, dated on the 4th of July 1776." The text is written on the top of the document.
Whether or not it was written by someone, it is known that the great scroll (which measures 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up at the beginning of its life to be stored.

The landing on D-Day and the subsequent battles freed the northern part of France, but the southern part was still not free.
He was controlled by the "Vichy"" Frenchmen. These were Frenchmen who had signed a peace treaty with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the occupiers, rather than fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies landed in southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks the Americans and the French liberating forces had liberated the south of France and turned their attention to Germany.
A civilisation is a distinct culture shared by a significant number of people who live together and work, a society.
The word civilisation comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civil, and civitas, which means city or city state.
Cities are the forerunners of nations. A civilised culture requires the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint and a proper dissemination.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving any significant historical evidence and fail to be recognised as genuine civilisations.
While the revolutionaries were fighting, the 13 states formed first a weak central government, which consisted of the Congress.
The Congress was not given the authority to tax, and there was no national executive or judicial authority, so it relied on the states to enforce its laws.
He had no power to suspend tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous approval of all States before they could be changed, and the States took the Central Government so little seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world and was the 2006 FIFA World Champions.
The most popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula One motor racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in the Nordic regions and Italians take part in international competitions and Olympic Games.
Japan has nearly 7000 islands (of which Honshu is the largest), which makes Japan the seventh largest island in the world.
Because of the cluster of islands, Japan is often referred to as an archipelago.
The beginning of Taiwan goes back to the 15th century, when European sailors passed by and recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
The Dutch East India Company established a trading post in the southwest of Taiwan in 1624, which led to a change in the cultivation methods of the indigenous people and employed Chinese labourers on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan and declared Taiwan in 1885 to be a province of the Qing Empire.
The Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, after the defeat in the First Chinese-Japanese War (1894-1895), in which it ceded Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is mainly made up of three buildings, namely the Intihuatana, the Sun Temple and the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex were rebuilt to give the tourists a better idea of how they looked originally.
In 1976, thirty per cent of Machu Picchu was restored, and the restoration work continues to this day.
For example, 35 mm is the most widely used format for still photography, which corresponds to the final film format of the analogue era.
It is still made, but it is even more important that it has been taken over by digital camera sensor formats.
It is actually 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format is therefore referred to as 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS format family, for example) have exactly the same or very similar aspect ratio.
The much-maligned and often mocked third rule is a simple directive that creates dynamism and at the same time preserves order in a picture.
It states that the intersection of the lines which divide a picture vertically and horizontally is the most effective place for the main motif (see example)." #
In this period of European history, the Catholic Church was under scrutiny.
It has been holding together the European states despite the different languages and customs for over a thousand years.
His omnipotence ruled over everyone, from the king to the ordinary citizen.
One of the most important Christian beliefs is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty.
The central authority of the church was in Rome for more than a thousand years. This concentration of power and money caused many to doubt whether this principle was respected.
In the immediate aftermath of the outbreak of hostilities in Germany, Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective, as it cut off vital military and civilian supplies from the country, despite this blockade being contrary to the universally recognised principles of international law that have been codified in several international conventions of the last two centuries.
Britain has mined international waters to prevent ships from penetrating whole sea areas, which is a danger even for neutral ships.
The response to this tactic was limited, and Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s pacifism and isolation were the dominant attitudes of most citizens and countries.
After the horrors of the First World War, the nations wanted to avoid another such situation in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States of America in order to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems and a recommendation letter from Charles Batchelor (his previous boss) to Thomas Edison.
The old China had a unique method of showing different periods of time in China and each family in power was a separate dynasty.
The dynastic periods between the different dynasties were also divided by periods of unstable division of provinces. The most famous of these periods was the period of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and the Jin dynasties.
In these times, there were bitter wars among many nobles vying for the throne.
The time of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died in the struggle for the highest throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are a lot of social and political effects such as the use of the metrical system, a retreat from absolutism to republicanism and nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a ruler alone.
Also, all professions were open to all male candidates, so that the most ambitious and best could succeed.
The same applies to the military, because the ranks were based on the caliber of the weapon.
The French Revolution inspired many oppressed people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed was very interested in things that went beyond the everyday life. He often visited a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Nur" (Light) to meditate.
The cave itself has survived the times and offers a lively picture of Mohammed's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, she is not easy to find, even if you know that she exists. Once you are in the cave, you are completely isolated.
Nothing but the clear, beautiful sky and the numerous surrounding mountains can be seen from the inside of the cave. From the inside of the cave very little of this world can be seen or heard.
The Cheops Pyramid is the only of the Seven Wonders of the World which still stands.
The Cheops Pyramid was built in the third century BC by the Egyptians. It is one of many great pyramids built to honour the dead Pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau or the 'Gizeh Necropolis' in Egypt comprises several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honour of the Pharaoh Cheops and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honour of his wives and family members.
The "dressing" symbol looks like a V and the "shaving" symbol looks like a square, where the lower line is missing.
Up means that you start at the top and move the arrow.
The erasing generates a softer sound, while the erasing is more powerful and expressive.
You are free to add your own pencil marks; however, the printed lines are there for musical reasons, and therefore should be respected.
The King of France, Queen Marie-Antoinette, her two small children (Marie-Therese, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old) and the sister of the King, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris by a mob of market women on 6 October 1789.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a mob of people who threatened the king and queen with violence.
The mob forced the King and Queen to open their windows.
Sometime later, a member of the angry mob turned his head in the direction of the royal guard that had been killed in Versailles.
The US imperialists’ war expenditures in the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the U. S. to cover the bulk of the expenditures, and the interest on the bonds flowed through the banks of Wall Street in the name of the Filipino Government.
Of course, the superprofits that emanated from the continual exploitation of the Filipino people were the fundamental profits of the US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context in which the Order was founded.
The period in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history that spanned the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended in unison around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term which encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technology-push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that the human fate is determined by a fundamental logic which is linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Many interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas. First, that the development of technology is a process that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and second, that technology itself has ‘effects’ on societies that are more intrinsic than socially determined.
It is possible to say that the motor vehicle is the inevitable consequence of the development of roads.

The widespread ownership of cars also leads to an increase in road accidents, which in turn leads to the invention of new technologies in the health sector for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element, which was derived from writers like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography was the geography that molded individuals. Over time, customs and cultures developed with reference to this geography and these, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
So, as Paris is known as the capital of fashion today, so was Constantinople the capital of the feudal Europe.
His fame as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 BC and lasted until around 1100 BC.
His status fell in the twelfth century, mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices which were considered more valuable than the offerings of the Byzantine markets.
At that time the title of the fashion capital of the world was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic architecture reached its peak in the period between the 10th-11th and the 14th century.
At the beginning, the clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, Western styles are 25 to 30 years behind the pace of communication.
In the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop a distinct style. One of the most important developments of the time was the development of buttons as a means of fastening clothing.
Agricultural economy is agriculture that is aimed at producing as many food products as possible to meet the needs of the farmer or farmer's family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often biological cultivation that uses surplus, in the region's ecoregion native seeds and uses rotational farming or other relatively simple techniques to maximise yield.
In the past, most farmers practised subsistence farming and in many developing countries this is still the case.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by social norms and enable them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures might be defined by age, ethnicity, class, place and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as such can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual or geographical.
The members of a subculture often signal their membership by a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits and jargon.
One of the most common ways of illustrating the importance of socialisation is to rely on the few unfortunate cases of children who have not been socialised by adults because of neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse during their childhood.
Those children are called "wild" or "wild". Some wild children were kept by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the neglect of the child was due to the inability of the parents to accept the severe intellectual or physical limitations of the child.
Wolf cubs may have suffered from massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were abandoned or escaped.
Some have been reared by animals alone; others have lived in the wild.
If it has been raised entirely by animals, it displays behaviours (in the context of its physical capabilities) that are almost entirely in accordance with those of its specific carer, such as its fear or indifference to humans.

Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a help that supports individuals in a new learning situation such as when using a new computer program or when starting a new project.
Arbeitsplätze können sowohl virtuell als auch real sein. Mit anderen Worten, ein Lehrer ist eine Form von Arbeitsplatz, aber auch das kleine Büroklammermännchen in Microsoft Office.
Virtual assistance is built into the software and is intended to question, suggest and explain the steps that the student might not be able to complete on his own.
Children are placed in foster homes for a variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse to extortion.
No child should be forced to grow up in a family environment which is not loving, nurturing and educationally oriented, but many are forced to do so.
For us, the care system is a piece of security for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving caregivers, a stable training and a reliable health care.
The foster home should be able to meet all the needs that the child has not been able to meet in the home from which he or she was removed.
The Internet connects elements of mass communication, as well as interpersonal communication.
The specific features of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the benefit-and-reward approach.
For example, learning and socialisation are mentioned as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
“Personal commitment” and “ongoing relationships” were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied the public reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings led to important findings for the interpretation of microexpressions, short-lived facial movements.
In particular, it is claimed that one can tell whether someone is lying by deducing the minimal changes in facial expression.
In his article The President's Speech Oliver Sacks showed how people who have lost the ability to understand language can still accurately assess the honesty of people.
He even asserts that the ability to interpret human behaviour may be shared by dogs like the Labrador Retriever.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two genetic pools: hidden and expressed.
Mutation leads to new genetic variations and selection removes these from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with each generation back and forth.
Out in the savannah it is very difficult for a primate with a digestive system like ours to meet its nutritional needs from available plant sources.
In addition, it has grave implications if you do not prevent it: depression, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for us unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal foods are not only easy to digest, but also provide large quantities of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
Overall, it should not surprise us that our own ancestors solved their protein problem in similar ways as chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep compensation is the process of goal-directed awakening during the normal sleep periods and the subsequent short sleep (10-60 minutes) later.
This can be achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without completely waking you up.
If you are someone who imagines the alarm clock in the night, you can place it on the other side of the room so that you have to leave the bed to turn it off.
Another way of looking at it is that you should drink a lot of fluids before going to bed (especially water or tea, which is known for its urinary stimulant effect). Therefore, you have to get up to go to the toilet.
The level of inner calm that a person has is inversely related to the level of tension in the body and the mind.
The lower the tension is, the greater the potential for positive energy.
Everyone can attain enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded to include the path of love of the Mahayana and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (Knowledge energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The centre of tibetan meditation is the goddess yoga. By visualising various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are opened and the enlightened consciousness is born.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to a cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war, the collision of the systems, the course and the culture led to the countries being at odds.

He should last for the next 40 years and be carried out in the real world by proxy armies on battlefields in Africa, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defence was already completely collapsed and the only hope was in a retreat and a reorganisation along the Romanian bridgehead.
The plans were, however, almost overnight obsolete when over 800,000 Soviet soldiers invaded the white Russian and Ukrainian fronts and created these after they invaded the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Pact, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is the most efficient mode of transporting large human and goods volumes over the oceans.
The task of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that a country is able to transport people and goods, whilst at the same time preventing the enemy from transporting people and goods.
One of the most significant recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign in World War II. The Americans tried to bring personnel and material across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy attempted to stop this traffic mainly by submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Britain exactly as the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were domesticated in the Zagros Mountains in Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribal peoples began to keep them as livestock to obtain milk, fur, meat and skin.
House goats were usually kept in herds, which wandered on hills or other pastures. They were cared for by goat herders, very similar to the more familiar sheep herders; often, it was children or adolescents. These pasture management
In the 16th century, England built railways to support its industry.
While the railway tracks were made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to travel faster than they could on the rougher roads of the time.
It became clear quite early on that the railways were more efficient if they had a railway track laid on a railway track.
This was the customary practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron railway was introduced.
The first known means of locomotion was walking. The first human being to walk was the Homo erectus, which means "standing man".
Your predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not go on a regular basis.
Two-footed species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3,9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have already walked on two legs some seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to help alleviate future suffering a little.
This is in many cases just like a symptomatic treatment. If you are not only temporary solutions, then we should find the root of the problem and treat it.
It is plainly obvious that the world has changed due to the scientific and technological progress of mankind, and that the problems have become more serious due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of the people.
After it was adopted by Congress on 4 July, a handwritten draft, signed by the President of the United States, John Hancock, and the Secretary of State, Charles Thomson, was sent to the printer of John Dunlap.
In the course of the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as "Dunlap broadsides.
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the Independence Hall on July 8.
A copy was sent to Washington on 6 July, which was read to the troops in New York on 9 July. A copy reached London on 10 August.
There are still 25 Dunlap broadsides that exist, the oldest of which are the original handwritten copies.
Many paleontologists now believe that there is a group of dinosaurs that survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
Many regard them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and fly.
But many things about birds still look like dinosaurs.
You have feet with scales and claws, you lay eggs and run on both hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the processing of information in binary form.
A binary number can only have one of two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, to use the computer jargon.
A poisoning may not be immediately apparent. The symptoms, for example vomiting, are so general that one cannot immediately make a diagnosis.
The best evidence for a poisoning by ingestion is the presence of an open container of medicines or toxic household chemicals.
Look at the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison.
The term 'wasp' is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this insect group.
This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs. These insects are very adaptable to parasitizing humans.
As well as bedbugs, they are nidicolous, meaning that they live in their nests or homes of their hosts.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which is the most common neurological disease among adults aged younger and middle-aged.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and the peripheral nerves.
According to research, the risk of developing MS in women is twice as high as in men.
A couple can decide that it is not in their own interest or in the interest of their child to raise a baby.
These couples can choose an adoption plan for their baby.
When a child is adopted, the biological parents give up their parental rights, so that another couple can take over parental responsibilities.
The main aim of science is to discover how the world works. This is the basis of most scientific investigations.
It is not only about experimentation, but also about testing hypotheses, which is a way of excluding or confirming a hypothesis. Scientific research is also guided by the questioning and observation of phenomena.
Natural scientists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts and in particular on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were widely accepted.
With the loss of Greek language skills, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behaviour are often the result of the presence of body-specific rhythms and their production by biological clocks.
The cycles of behaviour that are not only responses to external cycles are known in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-perpetuating oscillators that even in absence of external signals continue to oscillate in free-swinging cycles.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the most important evidences that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacteria.
They took two experiments, one in which they either labelled the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphor or a protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Variations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the particular piece of genetic material, and whether it is a germ cell.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism draws people to visit areas of natural beauty, including wild plants and animals.
Exxamples of activities on the ground are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
A good example of this is the visit, the taking of photographs and the studying of orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave small provincial towns with their cars to go to work and are passed by other people whose workplace is the place they just left.
In this dynamic pendulum motion, everyone is connected to a transport system based on private cars, and supports it.
The science now points out that this massive carbon economy has brought about a change in the stable state of the biosphere that has been in place for the last two million years.
Everyone takes part in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
You will rarely hear complaints about water quality or bridge collapses in developed countries.
Why are transport systems so inefficient? Why do they fail so often? Are transport engineers incompetent? Or is something fundamentally wrong going on here?
Traffic flow is the investigation of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them.
It is difficult to study traffic flows because one cannot predict the behaviour of drivers with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, motorists tend to behave reasonably consistent, so traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be mathematically expressed in a rough way.
To better illustrate the flow of traffic, the three main characteristics were defined: (1) river, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relations help in planning, designing and operating infrastructure on the road.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the skies. Their ability to fly helped them to evade enemies more easily and find more efficient food and mates.
Most insects can fold their wings along their bodies.
They have a wider range of small boots in which they can hide themselves from predators.
Little butterflies and moths are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
A man named Aristarch claimed that the sun was at the centre of the movements of the solar system thousands of years ago.
Many people thought he was right, but many others believed that the solar system including the sun (and even the other stars) moved around the earth.
It seems sensible to me that the Earth is not moving.
The Amazon is the second longest and the most water-rich river in the world. It flows more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, with a width of up to six miles.
A good 20% of the water that flows through the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon main stream is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It takes water from thousands of smaller rivers into it.
Although the construction of pyramids from stones continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Gizeh never surpassed their size and technical perfection.
Egyptians in the ancient New Kingdom admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were more than a thousand years old at the time.
The Vatican City has a population of around 800 people. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language of most of those who work in the State, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
The basic elements of chemistry such as gold, silver and copper have been known to mankind since the ancient times, since these can be found in their original form in nature and are easily extracted with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed the theory that all things are made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements. It was earth, water, air and fire.
This was more in line with the four states of aggregation (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma. He also posited that they would transform into new substances, to form what we see.
Metals are in essence a mixture of two or more elements. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are regarded as metals. Of course there are other metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
The universe is made up of matter in its entirety. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that billions of them would fit in the end of this sentence.
As a result, the pencil was invented by many people as a good friend.
It is unfortunate that the pencil has been pushed out of fashion by the introduction of new writing methods, so that it has been pushed back into its status and in its use.
Today, people write news on computer screens, without ever having to get close to a cliff.
I look forward to seeing what will come out of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The atomic bomb is based on the principle that energy is needed to combine a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like if you roll a heavy car up a hill. When the core is split, a portion of this energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable cores, which means that they will disintegrate even at the slightest provocation.
The surface of the moon is made up of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The outer shell is about 70 km thick on the near side and about 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the sea and thicker under the highlands.
There could be more Maria on the eastern side, because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
The content theories concentrate on finding what people are motivated by or attracted to.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalised during their growing up.
The theories concern what causes certain people to want exactly the things they do, and what influences in their environment cause them to do or not to do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
There are two possible behaviours when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to'stay one of the boys' (or one of the girls) or to become a'manager'.
This kind of manager has problems in making difficult, unpopular decisions, in disciplining people, in assigning responsibility, and in enforcing discipline.
At the other end of the spectrum, you become an unrecognizable individual who has to do everything differently than the team has done and takes everything on its own.
In the end, the manager is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This type of behaviour can often lead to friction between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are led by the same high standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members have a direct physical group often the function of a contact point.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams may meet in different time zones which may not be taken into account by the local management.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also an integral part of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the leadership team that reports to each member. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organisation take on the time-consuming process of introducing an organisational learning concept? An objective for the practical implementation of organisational learning concepts is innovation.
If all available resources are effectively used by all departments of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can arise.
In the end, the work of an organisation can lead to a new innovative procedure that takes into account the customer's need.
Before an organisation can be innovative, the leadership must develop a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and learning.
Angel (2006) explains the concept of the continuum as a way of helping organisations to become more effective.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognitive processes. This limits the research area and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that different types of brain damage such as trauma, injuries and tumours can influence behaviour and change some brain functions.
New technologies allow us to see and explore certain brain structures and processes for the first time.
This provides us with a lot of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand what is going on in our heads.
KI is not only associated with science fiction, but is also a very important branch of computer science dealing with behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence encompasses the production of machines that require intelligent behaviour.
For example, control, setting up strategies and timetables, the ability to answer customer questions and diagnose handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Things like these have become independent disciplines, which are focused on finding solutions for real life problems.
The KI system is now used in many areas of industry, medicine, engineering and military and is also incorporated into numerous software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of every school class. Often, a teacher would like to take her students to places where a bus trip is not possible.
Virtual excursions are a technical solution. The students can view museum pieces from their classrooms, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful art works.
Sharing a virtual trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennett School in North Carolina design and build a website every year about their trip to the capital of the state. The website is updated every year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a collection album.
Blogs can also help improve the writing skills of students. Although students at the beginning of their blog experience often have a sloppy grammar and spelling, this usually changes as a result of a readership.
Students are often very critical audiences, so the blog author tries to improve his writing style to avoid criticism.
The blogging forces students to learn more about the world around them. The need to engage the audience inspires students to write intelligently and interestingly.
Blogs are a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to continue learning outside of the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can empower pupils to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet material, pupils can define their own positions in relation to the texts of others and present their own perspectives on particular topics.
Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital of Canada and it has a number of art galleries and museums that present Canada's past and present.
In the south, the Niagara Falls are located, and in the north, the untouched beauty of nature spreads out in Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and other things make Ontario distinctive as what outsiders regard as typical of Canada.

A population comparison that many astonishes: There are more African-Americans in the US than Canadian citizens.
The islands in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Africa are located.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, as far as the animal world is concerned, a separate continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or attached to France and known as luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to the country as well, and in the Comoros and in Mayotte it was very successful.
The European influence and the colonialism started in the 15th century, when the Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
The region is bounded by the Sahel zone in the north and by the Atlantic Ocean in the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female travellers state that they are married, irrespective of their actual marital status.

Women should recognise that cultural differences can lead to what they regard as sexual harassment, and that it is not uncommon to be grabbed, tied up, etc.
Keep your principles, if you reject men, and do not hesitate to defend your position (cultural differences, or whatever)!
The present Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the tenth century before the beginning of time. It was used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Merinides as a strategic port with the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after a earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan built the city as Dar el Beida again and it was called Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places where traditional Moroccan goods such as Tagines, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of tinned food are sold, but that is all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the easternmost part of Rwanda.
In 2002 the city was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city, in particular the city centre.
While Goma is relatively safe, it is important to plan your stay outside Goma carefully so that you can get an idea of the situation in the province of North Kivu
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of the volcano Nyiragongo, as well as for some of the cheapest gorilla tracking tours in Africa." #
You can use Bodabodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The usual (local) fare is ~500 Congolese Francs for the short ride
This in combination with its relative remoteness has made "Timbuktu" a metaphor for exotic, faraway countries.
Although Timbuktu is known as a tourist attraction and has a airport, it is today a poor city.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites because of the threat of sandstorms.
It was one of the most important stops on the PBS special "Wonders of the African World.
The city stands out as a stark contrast to the rest of the cities in the country, because it is more of an Arab than an African feel.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the north-east of South Africa. It borders in the east with Mozambique, in the north with Zimbabwe and in the
The park has an area of 19.500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecosystems, each of which supports a different animal species.
He is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered to be the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As all South African National Parks, the park charges daily entry fees.
It is also worth buying a wild card, which gives you access either to selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the namesake of the territory of Hong Kong and is the focus of many tourists.
The buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline have been compared to a shimmering bar chart that is visible through the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best prospects for Hong Kong, you should leave Hong Kong and drive to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
The majority of the city formation of Hong Kong Island is concentrated along the newly acquired land along the north coast.
This is the place that the British colonists have taken over. If you look for traces of colonial past in the area, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forest in the world and extend for 80 km from the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland to the coast.
The Sundarbans were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is known as Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not only mangrove swamps - they also contain some of the remaining remnants of the mighty forest that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which 33% is covered by water and marshes.
The Sundarbans are a nature reserve since 1966 and estimates suggest that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and up to 30,000 spotted deer there.
Buses travel all day long from the district-wide bus station (on the other side of the river) and, apart from the buses heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30 in the morning
The buses between the districts are often full, so it is advisable to buy a ticket in advance.
Most of the districts are by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.

The Oyapock River Bridge is a curved cable bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 metres high, their length is 378 metres and they have two lanes with 3,50 m width.
The bridge's height is 15 meters. The works were completed in August 2011, but the opening for traffic was delayed until March 2017.
The bridge should be completed in September 2017. It is expected that the Brazilian customs checkpoints will then be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group that inhabited the present-day eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters, who
The Chaco region was also the home of other groups of indigenous peoples, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by
Paraguay, formerly the province of West Indies, was born out of the meeting of Spanish conquistadors with the native Indian groups.
The Spanish began the colonisation period which lasted for three centuries.
Asunción has been able to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity since 1537.
Argentina is well known for its polo team and its players being among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at Las Cañitas Polo fields.
Small tournaments and competitions can be watched here at other times of the year as well.
Informations about competitions and sales points for polo tickets can be found at the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is set in accordance with the value of the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged in the only bank on the island, which is opposite the FIC West Store.
The pound sterling is generally accepted everywhere on the islands and at Stanley credit cards.
In the remote islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, but British and American currency can be accepted; ask the owners in advance about the payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland Islands' currency outside the islands, so you should exchange your money before you leave the islands.
Montevideo is located south of the equator, so it is summer in the northern hemisphere and winter in the southern hemisphere.
Montevideo is in the subtropics. In the summer months, temperatures are usually over +30 °C.
The winter can be misleadingly cool: Temperatures rarely go below freezing, but wind and moisture lead to a feeling of colder than what the thermometer shows.
There is no pronounced seasonal rainfall or drought: The amount of rainfall over the year remains about the same.
Although many of the animals in the park have seen humans before, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, visitors must keep at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and at least 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals.
Even if Bisons, Wapitis, Elches, Bears and all the big animals look peaceful, it can still happen that they go on the attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not take enough space. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so leave them enough space.
Be aware that odours attract bears and other wildlife. Avoid carrying strong-smelling foods or cooking them and be aware of a clean storage area.
Apia is the capital of the island of Upolu and has a population of around 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 18th century and is the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the scene of a shameful stalemate in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All ships except one British cruiser were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans died.
While the Mau movement was organising the independence struggle, a peaceful meeting in the city led to the killing of the chief of the Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III tribe.
Auckland is spread over two harbours, so there are many beaches. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore lie on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
All of them are sandy beaches with safe bathing facilities and most offer shade, which is provided by the Pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located at the harbour of Waitemata, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
There are family beaches that are sometimes overcrowded, with a beautiful promenade along the coast. Swimming is here safe.
The most important local beer is "Number One". It is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is "Manta".
There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines are probably better tolerated.
Local tap water is safe to drink, but if you are concerned, you will also find bottled water.
For Australians, the idea of coffee ""flat white"" is foreign. A small black person is ""espresso"" and a cappuccino is served with a lot of foam (not with milk). Tea is
Hot chocolate is Belgian standard. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many trips to the reef take place throughout the year and injuries caused by any of these causes on the reef are rare.
However, you should follow the advice of authorities and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
Shellfish are common in the vicinity of beaches and in the vicinity of river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can also occur outside this period." #
Haies exist, but they rarely attack people. Most of the sharks are afraid of people and would flee.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live in the sea, their primary habitat is in river mouths north of Rockhampton.
A reservation in advance gives the traveller the assurance that he will have a place to stay when he arrives at the destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although you may also book other accommodation, such as camping sites, through a travel agency.
Travel agents usually offer packages in which breakfast, transport to and from the airport or even a combination of flight and hotel are included.
You can also hold your reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or to obtain further documents for your destination (for example, a visa).
Any changes or requests should be addressed first to the travel agency and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of festivalgoers decide to camp out, and most visitors think that is an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you must go early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that there will be music playing on some of the festival venues until very late, even if the main stages have stopped playing.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the North Sea in winter, check the state of the cabin, as the breaking of ice can be quite deafening for the most affected.
Cruises to St. Petersburg also offer time to visit the city. Passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos try to keep their guests as long as possible and to spend as much money as possible. There are no windows or clocks, and exits are sometimes difficult to find.
You usually have a special offer of food, drink and entertainment to keep the guests happy and ensure that they stay.
Some casinos offer alcoholic beverages free of charge. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good players know how important it is to remain sober." #
If you want to drive in high latitudes or over mountains, you should be prepared for snow, ice and temperatures below freezing.
On icy and snowy roads, the liability is low and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
In very short time, so much snow can fall that you can get stuck.
The visibility can also be affected by falling or drifting snow or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, however, cold and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and the traffic runs all year round largely uninterrupted.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
Safari" is a common term in the English language for a trip to see the overwhelming African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars close, and the standard equipment provides good visibility.
Leopards, lions and elephants are often shy and you can observe them better with a telescope.
A bushwalk is a walk that lasts for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held at other venues in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Olympic Summer Games, having already hosted the 1964 Summer Olympics.
If you have already booked your flights and accommodation for 2020, before the rescheduling was announced, you could find yourself in a difficult situation.
The cancellation policies vary, but from mid-March most cancellation policies did not apply until July 2020, for the Olympic Games were planned.
Man is of the opinion that most tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, a typical ticket will cost about ¥7,000.
Washing your clothes in the dryer can help to dry them. Many hotels provide irons and ironing boards, even if you are not present in the room.
If there is no iron available or you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer if one is available.
Take care that the fabric does not get too hot (it can shrink it or cause burns in extreme cases).
For cleaning water there are different procedures. Some of them prove to be more effective in dealing with certain dangers.
In some areas, it is enough to boil water for a minute, in other areas it must be several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you have any concerns, then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter some of the pests that they are not familiar with from their home regions.
Infestation can destroy food, cause irritation or even cause allergic reactions, poison or transmit disease.
Infections as such or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people are seldom classified as vermin.
Free trade is the opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from duties and taxes.
Travellers who have a destination country with a high tax rate can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, particularly in the case of products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmount on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway is perhaps the greatest driving challenge, as it often leads through remote, undeveloped country.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: steep gradients, narrow roads and sharp curves are prevalent here.
The speed limits given are noticeably lower than those given in the previous and following sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and their strict compliance is even more important than usual.
But interestingly, the mobile coverage here is much better than in many other areas of the route, for example, the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German bread is very tasty. In Bavaria, it is very rich and varied, as well as in Austria.
Bread made from apples is widely available all year round, and pears and plums are used in summer.
Many German cakes also contain almonds, hazelnuts or other nuts. Popular cakes often go particularly well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want to make small, but rich cakes, then try this, which is called Berliner, pancakes or crêpes in different regions.
A curry is a dish that is based on herbs and spices, with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either dry or wet depending on the amount of water.
In the interior of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is usually used in curries; in South India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is usually used
With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a catch-all term which encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines which can be found throughout the country
When the term is used without any further attributes, it usually refers to the food that originates from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine, which is now widely spread throughout the archipelago, offers a variety of simple spiced dishes. As flavouring agents, the Javans prefer nuts, chilis, sugar (especially javanese coconut sugar) and a variety of aromatic spices

Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has several independent countries. Normally you would have to apply for multiple visas and go through multiple passport controls if you wanted to travel through several countries.
The Schengen area works in this respect, however, somewhat like a country.
So long as you remain within this zone, you can normally cross the border without having to go through the passport control again.
In general terms, you do not have to apply for a Schengen visa for each of the Schengen Member States individually, which saves time, money and bureaucracy.
