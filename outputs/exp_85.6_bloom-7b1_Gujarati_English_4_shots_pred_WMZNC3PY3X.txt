When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from its main group (for example, they move to a mountain or a river when they leave their home, or they move to a new island where they can not return) they are in a new environment.
These new environments have different sources and different competitors, so new generations need to be stronger competitors than they were before, they need to have different facilities or fit.
The fundamental population hasn't changed a bit, they still need the same kind of fit.
Over time, they become less and less visible.
Finally, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will look alike and they will not be able to distinguish them as different species.
We call this process as specialization, which means only new species are created. Clarification is an inevitable result and evolution is an important part of it.

However, the plant-based diet of primates is not as well suited to meet their amino acid requirements as the diet of humans.
However, failure to do so could lead to serious consequences, including growth depression, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The easiest and most readily available plant resources are the leaves and seeds, but if they are cooked they are not easily digestible for humans.
Contrary to this, animals are not only easy to bite but also provide high quality protein that is rich in all the essential amino acids.
But it is not surprising that our ancestors would have solved the protein problem in the same way as they solved the problem of the Champa kingdom.
Interruption of sleep is a process of awakening and returning to sleep (10-60 minutes).

But they had only wooden planks on the sides, but they were allowed to run faster and carry heavier loads on the longer and bumpy roads.

We can start a more environmentally friendly life, we can be part of the environmental movement, and we can be activists to reduce the future problems.
Just like many other diseases, this is also a curative treatment. However, if we are not getting a temporary solution, we should try to find the root cause and treat it.
