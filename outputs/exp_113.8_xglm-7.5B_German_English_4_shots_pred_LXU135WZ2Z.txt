This confirms not only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides details that fossils do not provide, such as colour and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the fur of this animal was on the top brown and on the bottom light- or carotenoid-coloured.
The find also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well developed sheath called a quill, but other characteristics of feathers — hooks and barbules — the researchers concluded that the quill must have been an evolutionary development later than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or for heart function.
Researchers claimed that the sample was the tail of a young dinosaur, but the sample showed no feathers of an adult.

The candidates may send representatives to witness the whole process. At night, the votes of volunteers will be counted under strict supervision and in accordance with special procedures.

The police chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused had appeared with their faces covered in court.
Though three people were in the house when the car drove into it, no one was injured.
The driver was injured, however, severely.
The road, on which the accident took place, was temporarily closed while the rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was subsequently charged with murdering her son.
She is in custody until the prosecution and trial, but eyewitness statements could be exaggerated because her image has been widely published.
This is a practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish judiciary works differently, and the courts have considered the publication of photographs as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, a professor at the University of Dundee, said: "Journalists seem to be crossing a dangerous line when they publish pictures of suspects.
The Crown Office has hinted that no further comments will be made to journalists until the prosecution has proceeded.
According to a leak, the document refers to the border dispute in which the Palestinians demand a reversal of the borders in the state of 1967 before the Six-Day
Other issues, which are allegedly covered, include the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel wants a military presence in the Jordan Valley for 10 years from the signing of the agreement, the Palestinian Authority is willing to accept only 5 years.
The sniper teams accompanying the attempt to control the outbreak should be closely supervised by rangers, as the attempt has been monitored and evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited for the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Managing Director of Park Conservation and Heritage, the four selected hunters received comprehensive security and training training.
Martelly has just appointed a new Provisional Election Commission (CEP) with nine members.
It is his fifth CEP within four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of the package of measures to steer the country in the direction of new elections.
The Commission was the response of President Martelly to the widespread regime-critical protests that began in October.
The trigger for the sometimes violent protests was the failure to hold elections, some of which are due to take place in 2011.
Over 60 cases of overheating have been reported with iPods. In total, six fires have been set and four people have suffered minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that it had 27 accidents in connection with the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy and Technology informed Apple of 34 more cases of overheating that it deemed to be "not serious
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded by describing Apple's decision to postpone the report as "really regrettable.
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 p.m. (21:19 GMT on Friday)
The Office for Civil Protection of the Northern Marians said that no damage reports have been received.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center had declared that there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has kidnapped tourists from Hong Kong by forcing their bus into Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot with his M16 rifle at the tourists.
At least six confirmed dead have been rescued.
Six hostages, including the children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers took the place of an elderly lady as she had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and became a doctor.
He became a midwife and took up his work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working in the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature contractions.
His research showed that the application of a hormone accelerated the lung development of the foetus.
Xinhua reported that investigators from the government have recovered two "black box" flight recorders
Ringer colleagues also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of extremes. My first manager. Luna died in the night of the two moons. Very unique, exactly like she. A strong woman.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels gave the following comment: "Luna was as crazy as I was... maybe even crazier... I love her and I will miss her... hopefully she is somewhere better.
Of the 1,400 people who were surveyed in the run-up to the federal elections in 2010, the proportion of those who oppose Australia becoming a republic has risen by 8 percent since 2008.
The temporary acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard declared during the election campaign for the federal election that she believed Australia would eventually become a republic.
34 per cent of respondents share this view and want that Elizabeth II is the last Australian monarch.
29 per cent of those surveyed said that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 per cent of those polled said that Australia should never become a republic.
The gold medal winner at the Olympic Games should swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three-person relay events, but because of his many complaints, his fitness was doubted.
He was not able to take the necessary medication to overcome his pain, as they are banned at the Commonwealth Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Many people confirmed the discovery via different hardware and software in February and on Tuesday it was announced.
Cosmic dust may have been a source of water supply for the Earth, together with organic matter that can form proteins and enable life." #
Because comets collided with the Earth many years ago, scientists are hoping to gain insights into how planets, in particular the Earth,
Cuomo (53) took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He described the rumours as "political nonsense and idle chatter.
It is speculated that he may be nominated for the post of President in 2016.
NextGen is a system claimed by the FAA that would allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology rather than the older technology based on ground radar to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more precisely and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport facilities will be provided and the underground trains will not stop at Wembley. There are no parking or parking-and-ride facilities available at the venue.
With the fear of transport problems growing, the likelihood that the game would be played without the fans of the team behind closed doors grew.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the emergence of a new bird species on the ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and the Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species had developed within just two generations, despite the previous assumption that this process took much longer due to the mating between a native Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into a number of different forms. It can be rolled into tiny pieces.
It can be drawn into a thin wire which can be twisted and woven. It can be hammered or rolled into leaves.
It can be made so thin that it sometimes became a substitute for painting on metal, called picture-handwriting, to decorate books called picture-handwriting books.
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator with red apple juice.
The carbon dioxide changes its colour, depending on whether it is acidic or basic (alkaline).
The pH level points to the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemicals." #
Protons are electrons that have been removed from water molecules (because water molecules consist of a proton and
Mix the two dry powders together and then form them into a ball with clean, damp hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a protective layer.
The cities Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had almost every house equipped with a flush toilet, which was connected to an elaborate
Wastewater systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia and China there were toilets. In Roman culture, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses that men and women visited in mixed company.
If you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it almost immediately back down.
The satellite was launched by a rocket into space. Scientists use telescopes in space, because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and our view.
It is necessary to launch a gigantic rocket with a height of more than 100 feet to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest service it has given us is much easier and faster transport.
It has brought us the railway, the car and many other means of transport.
In addition to cats of medium size, which eat prey of medium size, from rabbits to antelopes and deer, there are also small mammals.
Finally, there are still many small cats (including free-running domestic cats) that eat much smaller prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a special task that every cat has and which ensures that they do not compete with other cats.
 Lions are the most social cats. They live in large groups, which are called 'herds'.
The herds consist of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and young.
Women usually have a close relationship with each other when they live in a large family with sisters and daughters.
Lions are similar to wolf packs, animals that surprise the lion (but not other big cats) in their behavior and are equally deadly to their prey.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (although not particularly well), swim, long distances jump and with the fivefold power of a strong man pull.
The tiger is in the same family (genus) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger does not sound like the confident roar of the lion, but rather like a series of grumbling grumbling words.
Ocelot hunters eat small animals. If they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than he is.
Scientists think that otters track prey with their sense of smell and then sniff it, where they have been lying down.
They can see in the dark very well and move undetected. Ocelots hunt their prey by matching their environment visually and then leaping at their prey.
If a small group of animals (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it comes (for example, if they move over a mountain or a river or if they migrate to a new island, so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has other resources and other competitors, so that the new population needs different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor than what it used to need.
The original population has not changed at all. It still needs to adapt itself to the same changes as before.
As time goes by, the new population adapts to its new environment, and then it looks increasingly like the other population.
After tens of thousands or even millions of years, two populations will look so different that they will no longer be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the emergence of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that we breathe, and they take carbon dioxide that we exhale (which is to say, exhale).
Plants produce their food by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses out of plants and make clothes out of plants. We eat mainly plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the largest predator of its time, so it feared nothing but other Mosasaurs.
His long jaws were equipped with more than 70 sharp teeth, including a second set on the tongue, which meant that there was no escape for any animal that crossed his path.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a hooked tongue. He ate mainly fish, large fish, other Mosasaurs and maybe even a cannibal.
He also took everything that came in to the water; even a great dinosaur like the T. Rex was not going to be able to withstand him.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual meals, including wild boar, peacock, snails and a kind of frog called the Seven-Headed Snake.
Another difference was that the poor people ate their food on chairs. The rich men preferred to hold banquets where they sat on the side, while they ate their meals.
Ancient Roman courts could not contain food that came from America or Asia in later centuries.
They had no wheat, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no Romans ever ate a turkey.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a temple, which was regarded as the house of the god.
Man offered sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to comply with the will of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an open temple and then an inner altar room which was only accessible by priests.
Often, special pyramidal towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the
The top of the tower was a special shrine for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses did not have such a great importance.
The majority of the time spent by the Hebrew family was spent outdoors.
The women cooked in the yard. There were simply open shop windows. For the house construction, stone was used.
In Canaan there were no large forests, so that wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely settled. In the old Norse legends Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder. When he travelled further west he found Greenland and gave it the name Greenland.
But regardless of its discovery, the Eskimo people there lived already at that time.
Although all the countries were'scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the film Templer, you may think that on the back of the Declaration of Independence there was a map of treasure.
That is not true. Although on the reverse of the document there is written something, it is not a treasure map.
The declaration is written on the reverse side, with the words 'original declaration of independence, dated on 4 July 1776'.
Whether or not it was written by someone, it is known that the great scroll (which measures 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up at the beginning of its life to be stored.
It is therefore possible that the note was added simply as a label.
The landing on D-Day and the subsequent battles freed the north of France, but the south was still not free.
He was ruled by the "Vichy"" French. These were French who in 1940 signed a peace treaty with the Germans and worked with the occupiers, rather than fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies landed in southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the French liberated the south of France and turned their attention to Germany.
A civilisation is a distinct culture shared by a significant number of people who live together and work, a society.
The word 'civilisation' comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin word civis, which means citizen and civitas, which means city or city-state.
Cities are the forerunners of nations. A civilised culture implies the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint and a proper dissemination.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving any significant historical evidence behind and fail to be recognised as genuine civilisations.
While the revolutionaries were fighting for their independence, the 13 states formed on the basis of the United States Constitution first formed a weak central government, consisting of the Congress.
The Congress was not empowered to levy taxes, and there was no national executive or judicial authority, so it relied on the authorities of the states, which often did not cooperate.
He had no authority to suspend tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous consent of all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so little seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world and was 2006 FIFA World Champions.
Favourite sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula One motor racing.
 Winter sports are popular in the northern regions and Italians take part in international competitions and Olympic Games.
Japan has nearly 7000 islands (of which Honshu is the largest), making it the seventh largest island in the world.
Because of the archipelago/group of islands, Japan is often referred to as an archipelago.
The beginning of Taiwan goes back to the 15th century, when European sailors passed through the island and named it Ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
1624 the Dutch East India Company establishes a trading post in the South-West of Taiwan, which leads to a change in the cultivation methods of the indigenous people and employs Chinese workers on their rice and sugar plantations." #
In 1683, when the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan, it declared Taiwan to be a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
1895, the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists mainly of three buildings, namely the Intihuatana, the Sun Temple and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex were rebuilt to give tourists a better impression of how they looked originally.
Up until 1976, thirty per cent of Machu Picchu was restored, and the restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most widely used film format is 35 mm, which corresponds to the end of the analog film era.
It is still made, but it is more important that its format has been taken over by the digital camera formats.
In fact, the so-called 35 mm format is confusingly 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The ratio of this format (divided by twelve, to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore referred to as 3:2.
Many of the usual formats (the APS format family, for example) have exactly the same or very similar aspect ratio.
The oft-maligned and often mocked third rule is a simple directive that creates dynamism and at the same time preserves order in a picture.
It states that the intersection point of the lines that divide a picture vertically and horizontally is the most effective place for the main motif (see example).
In this period of European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church was under the scrutiny of the Church.
Since more than a thousand years, Christianity has kept the European states united despite different languages and customs.
His omnipotence ruled over everyone, from the king to the humblest citizen.
One of the most important Christian beliefs states that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that it is the money of the churches that are there for this reason.
The central authority of the Church was in Rome for more than a thousand years. This concentration of power and money caused many to doubt whether this principle had been adhered to.
In the immediate aftermath of fighting breaking out in Germany, Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective, as it cut off the country from life-saving military and civilian supplies, despite this blockade violated the generally accepted international law that has been codified in several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain polluted international waters in order to prevent ships from penetrating whole oceanic areas, which was a danger for neutral ships as well
The response to this tactic was limited, and Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s pacifism and isolation were the dominant attitudes of most citizens and countries.
After the horrors of the First World War, the nations of the world wanted to avoid another such situation in the future.
Edison's New York City laboratory was the first place where Tesla worked.
He came to the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry and a recommendation letter from Charles Batchelor (his previous boss) to Thomas Edison.
The ancient China had a unique way of showing different eras in China and each family in power was a separate dynasty.
In the course of the dynastic periods there were also periods of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the period of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and the Jin Dyna
In these times, there were bitter wars fought by many nobles vying for the throne.
The time of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died in the struggle for the highest throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metrical system, a departure from absolutism towards republicanism and nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a ruler alone.
Also, all professions were open to all male applicants, so that the most ambitious and best succeeded.
The same applies to the military, since the rankings used to determine the military ranks now take into account the caliber of the weapon.
The French Revolution inspired many oppressed people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed was very interested in things that went beyond the everyday life. He often visited a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Nur" (light), to meditate.
The cave itself has survived the times and offers a lively picture of Mohammed's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It is not easy to find, even if you know that it exists. Once you are in the cave, you are completely isolated.
You can see nothing but the clear, beautiful sky above and the numerous surrounding mountains. From the inside of the cave, very little of this world can be seen or heard.
The Cheops Pyramid is the only of the seven wonders of the world that still stands.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Cheops Pyramid is one of many great pyramids structures built to honor the dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau or the 'Gizeh Necropolis' in Egypt comprises several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples and the Great Sp
The great pyramid was built in honour of the Pharaoh Cheops and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honour of his wives and family members.
The 'dressing' symbol looks like a V and the'removing' symbol looks like a square, with the lower line missing.
Up" means that you start at the top and pull the bow. "Down" means that you start at the bottom and pull the bow.
The erasing generates a softer sound, while the erasing is more powerful and expressive.
You are free to add your own pencil marks; however, the printed lines are there for musical reasons, so they should be respected in the normal course.
The terrified King Louis XIV, Queen Marie-Antoinette, her two small children (the eleven-year-old Marie-Therese and the four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the sister of the King, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris by a mob of market women on 6 October 1789.
They travelled in a carriage back to Paris, surrounded by a mob of people shouting threats against the King and the Queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to open their windows wide.
Sometime later a member of the angry mob turned his head in the direction of a royal guard killed in Versailles.
The US imperialists' war expenditures in the Philippines were borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover the bulk of expenditure, and the interest on the bonds flowed through the banks of Wall Street in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the superprofits that derive from the continued exploitation of the Filipino people were the fundamental profits of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you need to understand the context in which they were founded.
The period in which the events took place is generally referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history that extends over the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000–1300 A.D.).
The Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended in approximately 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technology-push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that the human fate is determined by a pre-existing logic that is linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas. Firstly, that the development of technology is a process that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and secondly, that technology itself has effects on societies which are more intrinsic than socially determined.
It is possible to say that the motor vehicle is a necessary development of roads.
However, a national road network for only a small number of cars is economically unsustainable. Therefore, new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The widespread ownership of cars also leads to an increase in the number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques in the health sector for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a strong, cultural deterministic element which was drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography was the key to shaping individuals. Over time, customs and cultures developed with reference to this geography and these, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
So, as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so was Constantinople known as the fashion capital of the feudal Europe.
His fame as the epicenter of luxury began about 400 B.C. and lasted until about 1100 A. D.
His status declined in the 12th century, mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices which were regarded as more valuable than the offerings of the Byzantine markets.
At that time, too, the title of the fashion capital of the world was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries.
At the beginning, the clothing was strongly influenced by the culture of Byzantium in the East.
However, western styles are 25 to 30 years behind the rest of the world.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop a distinctive style. One of the most important developments of the time was the fact that people began to use buttons to fasten their clothing.
Needs management is agriculture that aims to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer or the farmer's family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often biological farming method that uses surplus, locally available seeds and combines rotational farming or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
In the past, most farmers practised subsistence farming and in many developing countries, this is still the case.
Subcultures bring together people who feel neglected by social norms and enable them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be differentiated on the basis of age, ethnicity, class, place and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as such can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual or geographical in nature or a combination of these factors.
The members of a subculture often signal their membership by a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits and jargon.
One of the most common methods of illustrating the importance of socialization is to rely on the few unfortunate cases of children who have not been socialized by adults because of neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse during their childhood.
Those children are called "wild" or "wild." Some wild children were kept by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, neglect was due to the inability of parents to accept the severe intellectual or physical limitations of the child.
Wolf cubs may have suffered massive child abuse or experienced traumatic experiences before they were abandoned or escaped.
Others have been reared by animals; some have lived alone in the wild; others have been reared in captivity.
If it has been raised entirely by animals, the wild child displays behaviours (in the context of his or her physical capabilities) that almost completely match those of his or her specific carer, such as his or her fear or indifference to people.
Project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, but the "scaffolding" goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but rather a help that supports individuals in a new learning situation such as when they are using a new computer program or when they are starting a new project
Gerüstskonstruktionen können sowohl virtuell als auch real sein. Ein Lehrer ist eine Form von Gerüst, aber auch das kleine Büroklammermännchen in Microsoft Office.
Virtual assistance is built into the software and is intended to question, suggest and explain the steps that the student may not be able to manage alone.
Children are placed in foster homes for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion.
No child should have to grow up in a environment that is not caring, loving and educational, but many are forced to do so.
For us, the care system is a piece of security for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe, loving home, caring parents, a stable education and a reliable health care.
The foster home should cover all the needs that they would not have had in the home from which they were previously removed.
The Internet connects both elements of mass communication, as well as interpersonal communication.
The specific features of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the utility- and reward-based approach.
For example, learning and socialisation are cited as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal engagement and sustained relationships were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined the audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings led to important findings for the interpretation of microexpressions, short-lived facial movements.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect deception by deducing the minimal changes in facial expression.
In his article, The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks showed how people who have lost the ability to understand language can still accurately assess the honesty of people.
He even claims that the ability to interpret human behaviour may be shared with animals such as dogs.
Scientific research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation results in new genetic variations and selection removes these from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with each generation in and out.
Out in the savannah, it is very difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of a human to meet its nutritional needs from available plant-based sources.
In addition, there are very serious consequences if you do not take action: depression, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for us, unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal sources of food (insects, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide large amounts of proteins that contain all essential amino acids." #
In general, it should not surprise us if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way as chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep compensation is the process of targeted waking during normal sleep periods and the subsequent short sleep (10-60 minutes) later.
This can be achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up, without completely waking you up.
If you are someone who imagines the alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room so that you have to leave the bed to turn it off.
Another method based on the circadian rhythm is to drink a lot of fluid before going to bed (especially water or tea, which is known for its urinary-tonic effect), so that one has to get up to urinate.
The degree of inner calm that a person has is inversely proportional to the degree of tension in the body and mind.
The lower the tension is, the more positive the existing life force. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can attain enlightenment. The only obstacle to this goal is our own tension and negativity.
The Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has been expanded to include the path of love of the Mahayana and numerous techniques of the Indian yoga
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (awakening energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation is the goddess yoga. Through visualisation of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are opened and the
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, which led to a cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war, the collision of systems, the course and culture of the countries led to that they became enemies.
Two years after the end of the war, the former Allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
He should last for the next 40 years and in reality be carried out by proxy armies on battlefields in Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defence was already completely broken and the only hope lay in a retreat and a reorganisation along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans were, however, almost overnight obsolete, when over 800,000 Soviet troops invaded the white Russian and Ukrainian fronts and created them, after they had invaded the western regions of Poland in violation of the so-called Riga Pact, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is the most efficient way to transport large human and goods volumes over the seas.
The task of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that a country is able to continue to transport people and goods, while at the same time preventing the enemy from transporting people and goods.
One of the most significant recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans attempted to bring personnel and material to the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy attempted to stop this traffic mainly by submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Britain exactly as the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were domesticated in the Zagros Mountains in Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and peoples began to keep them as livestock to get easily at their milk, fur, meat and skin.
Sheep were usually kept in herds, which wandered on hills or other pasture areas. They were looked after by shepherds, like the more familiar sheepherders; often they were children or adolescents. This grazing method is still used today.
In the 16th century, engineers in England built railways.
Although the railway tracks consisted of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to travel faster and carry heavier loads than on the rougher roads of the time.
Since early on, barriers have been introduced to ensure that the railway network is protected. Gradually, however, it became apparent that railways carrying a railway track are more efficient.
This was customary, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Finally, the wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron railway tracks were introduced.
The first known mode of locomotion was walking. The human species began walking about two million years ago with the appearance of the Homo erectus (which means "standing upright").
Your predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk so regularly.
Two-footed species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4,2 to 3,9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can live more sustainably, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate future suffering a little.
It is in many cases just a symptomatic treatment. If you want to solve the problem at its root, then you should look for the root of the problem and treat it.
It is really obvious that the world has changed due to the scientific and technological progress of mankind and that the problems due to overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles of people have become more serious.
After its adoption by the Congress on 4 July, a handwritten draft, signed by the Congress President John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to the printer of John Dunlap some blocks away.
In the course of the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as "Dunlap broadsides.
The first reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the Independence Hall on 8 July.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsheets that are still extant are the oldest still extant copies of the document. The original handwriting has not survived the
Many paleontologists now believe that there is a group of dinosaurs that have survived and still live today. They are called birds.
Many people see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But many things about birds still look like dinosaurs.
You have feet with claws and scales, lay eggs and run on both hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the processing of information in binary form.
A binary number can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or as bits, to use computer jargon.
A poisoning can be detected only after a period of time. The symptoms, for example vomiting, are so general that it is not possible to make a diagnosis immediately.
The best evidence for a poisoning by ingestion is the presence of an open container of medicines or toxic household chemicals.
Look at the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison.
The term 'wasp' is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this insect group.
This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs. These insects are very adaptable to parasitizing people.
As well as bedbugs, also fleas are nidicolous, i.e. adapted to live in the nest or the dwelling of their hosts.
In the United States of America there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which is the most common neurological disease in adults aged younger and middle-aged.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and the peripheral nerves.
Studies have shown that the risk of developing MS is twice as high for women as for men.
A couple can decide that it is not in their own interest or in the best interests of their child to have a baby.
The couples can decide for an adoption plan for their baby.
A child adopted by his or her biological parents gives up his or her parental rights, so that another couple can take over parental responsibilities.
The main aim of science is to discover how the world works. This method is in fact the basis of most scientific studies.
But it is not only about experimentation, where an experiment is a test that is used to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also guided by the setting of questions and the observation of phenomena.
Natural scientists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were widely accepted.
With the loss of Greek language skills, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behaviour are often based on the presence of body-specific rhythms and their production by biological clocks.
A set of behaviours that are not only responses to external cycles, but are also known in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that even in the absence of external signals will continue to oscillate for a time.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the most important evidences that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacteria.
They took two experiments, one in which they either tagged the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphor or a protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the genetic material concerned and whether it is a germline cell.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cancer or death.
Nature tourism draws people to visit areas of natural beauty, including wild flora and fauna.
Exemplary activities are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
An example of this is the visit, photography and studying of orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave small provincial towns with their cars to go to their workplace and are passed by other people whose workplace is the place they just left.
In this dynamic transport system, all are in some way linked to a transport system based on private cars and support it.
Now, science has pointed out that this massive carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone takes part in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries you will rarely hear complaints about water quality or collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems fail so often? Are transport engineers just incompetent? Or is something fundamentally wrong going on here?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them.
It is difficult to study traffic flows, because you cannot predict driver behaviour with 100% certainty.
Thankfully, drivers tend to behave reasonably consistently; therefore, flows of traffic have a certain consistency and can be represented mathematically in
To better represent the flow of traffic, the relationships between the three main characteristics were defined: (1) river, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relations help in the planning, design and operation of facilities on the road.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the sky. Their ability to fly helped them to evade enemies more easily and find more food and mates.
Most insects can fold their wings along their bodies.
They have a wider choice of small boots in which they can hide themselves from predators.
Today, butterflies and moths are the only insects that can not fold their wings.
In the distant past, a man named Aristarch claimed that the sun was at the centre of the movements of the solar system.
Many people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system including the sun (and even the other stars) revolved around the earth.
It seems reasonable, because it does not seem to you that the Earth moves?
The Amazon is the second longest and the most water-rich river in the world. It flows more than eight times as much water as the second largest river
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, with some stretches of up to six miles wide.
20 percent of the water that flows through rivers on the planet flows into the oceans from the Amazon.
The Amazon basin mainstem is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It takes water from thousands of smaller rivers into it.
While the building of pyramids continued in stone until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Gizeh were never surpassed in their size and the technical perfection of their construction.
Egyptians in the ancient New Kingdom gazed at the monuments of their forefathers, which were then more than a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of around 800 people. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the smallest population in the world.
The Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language of most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known to mankind since the ancient times, since these can be found in their original form in nature and are extracted and mined with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, posited the theory that all things are made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements. This mixture was earth, water, air and fire.
It was more in line with the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma. He also posited the theory that they would change into new substances to form what we see.
Metals are in essence a mixture of two or more elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are regarded as metals. Of course there are also other metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
The universe is made up of matter in its entirety. All matter consists of tiny particles, which are called atoms.
Atoms are so small that billions of them would fit in the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was made to be a good friend to many people.
It is sad that the pencil has been pushed aside by the rise of new writing methods, so that it has been pushed back in its status and in its use.
People write news on computer screens without ever having to get close to a rocket launcher.
It will be interesting to see what the keyboard will look like when something new comes along.
The atomic bomb is based on the principle that energy is required to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
So, like if you roll a heavy car up a hill. If the core is split, some of this energy will be released.
Some atoms have unstable cores, which means that they will break down even at the slightest provocation.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The outer layer is about 70 km thick on the near side and about 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the sea and thicker under the highlands.
On the near side, there could be more Maria, since the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding out what people are interested in or attracted to.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or wishes that are developed over time.
The theories concern what certain people do to want exactly the things they do, and what influences in their environment cause them to want to do certain things or not to do them.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two behaviours can emerge when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to'stay one of the boys' (or of the girls) or to'stay one of the girls'.
This sort of manager has problems, to take unpopular decisions, to carry out disciplinary measures, to assign responsibility, and to hold people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum one becomes an unrecognizable individual who has to change everything as the team has done and takes everything for itself.
The ultimate responsibility for the success or failure of the team lies with the team leader.
This behaviour often leads to friction between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are managed in the same way as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members have often the function of a contact point for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, since their teams can meet in different time zones, which may not be taken into account by the local leadership.
The presence of a truly invisible team (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also an unique component of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the leadership team that reports to each member. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organisation undertake the time-consuming process of introducing an organisational learning concept? A target for the practical implementation of organisational learning concepts is innovation.
If all available resources are effectively used by all departments of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can arise.
In the end, the joint work of a Community organisation can lead to a new innovative process, to respond to customer needs.
Before an organisation can be innovative, the leadership must develop a culture of innovation and shared knowledge, as well as the development of organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the concept of the continuum as a method to help organisations become more efficient.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognitive processes. This limits the research field and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that various types of brain damage such as trauma, injuries and tumours can influence behaviour and cause changes in some brain functions.
New emerging technologies allow us to see and explore certain brain structures and processes for the first time.
This provides us with many information and material to build simulation models that will help us understand the processes in our heads.
KI will be seen as a strong link in the field of computer science, but it is also a very important branch of computer science that deals with behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in the field of KI includes the production of machines for automating tasks that require intelligent behaviour.
For example, control, the setting of strategies and timetables, the ability to answer customer questions and diagnoses, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Things like these have become independent disciplines, which concentrate on finding solutions to problems of the real world.
The artificial intelligence system is now being used in a wide range of fields, including economics, medicine, engineering and military, and is also incorporated into numerous software applications for home computers and video games." #
Excursions are an important part of every school class. Often a teacher would like to take her pupils to places where a bus journey is not possible.
Virtual field trips are a technical solution. The pupils can view museum objects from their classroom, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful art works.
Sharing a virtual trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and to share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design each year a website about their trip to the capital of the state. The website is updated each year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a collection album.
Blogs can also help to improve the writing skills of pupils. Although pupils at the beginning of their blog experience often have a sloppy grammar and spelling, this usually changes when there is a public.
Students are often very critical audiences, so the blogger tries to improve his writing style to avoid criticism.
The blogging forces the students to learn more about the world around them. The need to attract the audience's interest inspires the students to write smart and interestingly.
Blogging is a tool which inspires collaboration and encourages pupils to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can help students to become more analytical and critical; by responding to Internet material, students can define their positions in the context of texts of others and articulate their own perspectives on particular topics.
Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital of Canada and is home to a number of art galleries and museums that present Canada's past and present
In the south are the Niagara Falls, and in the north the untouched beauty of nature extends to Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and other things make Ontario unique as what is considered typical of Canada by outsiders.
The large areas further north are almost completely uninhabited and some are almost wild.
A population comparison that many surprises: There are more African Americans in the USA than Canadian citizens.
The islands in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Africa are located.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, as far as the animal world is concerned, a separate continent." #
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or attached to France and are known as luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to the land, and in the Comoros and in Mayotte it was very successful.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
The northern region is bounded by the Sahel zone and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travellers declare their marital status irrespective of their actual marital status.
The wearing of a ring is helpful (no ring, please)
Women should recognise that cultural differences can lead to what they regard as an attack, and that it is not uncommon to be followed, handcuffed, etc.
Keep your principles firm, even if you reject men, and don't be afraid to defend them (cultural differences aside; that doesn't mean it's okay!)
Today's Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Merinides as a strategic port with the name Anfa." #
The Portuguese destroyed them and rebuilt them under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon them after a major earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan built the city as Dar el Beida again and it was called Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
It is easy to find places in the old Medina where traditional Moroccan goods such as Tagines, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of tinned food are sold, but that is all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the extreme east near Rwanda.
In 2002 the city was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city centre.
While Goma is relatively safe, it is important to plan your stay outside Goma carefully to learn about the ongoing fighting in North Kivu.
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of the Nyiragongo volcano as well as for some of the cheapest gorilla tracking tours in Africa.
You can use Bodabodas (motorbike taxis) to get around Goma. The usual fare is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short
This in combination with its relative remoteness has made "Timbuktu" a metaphor for exotic, faraway countries.
Although Timbuktu is known as a tourist attraction and has a airport, it is now a poor city.
In 1990 it was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger because of the threat of sandstorms.
It was one of the most important stops on Louis Gates' PBS special "Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the cities of the country, because it is more of an Arab than an African feel to it.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa. It borders in the east with Mozambique, in the north with Zimbabwe and in
The park has an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecosystems, each supporting a different animal species.
He is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is regarded as the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As all South African national parks, Kruger National Park charges daily entry fees.
It may also be worth buying a wild card, which grants access either to selected national parks in South Africa or to all national parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island is the namesake of the territory of Hong Kong and is the focus of many tourists.
The buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline were compared to a shimmering bar chart that was visible through the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best hope of Hong Kong, you should leave the island and drive to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
The bulk of the city formation of Hong Kong Island is concentrated along the newly acquired land along the north coast.
This is the place that the British colonists have taken over. If you look for traces of colonial history in the area, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forest belt in the world and extend for 80 km from the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland to the coast.
The Sundarbans were declared a World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is known as Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not only mangrove swamps - they also encompass some of the last remaining remnants of the mighty forest which once covered the Ganges
The Sundarbans extend over an area of 3,850 km2, of which one third is covered by water and marshes.
The Sundarbans are a nature reserve since 1966, and estimates suggest that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer there.
Buses run all day long from the district-wide bus station (on the other side of the river) and most of the buses, especially those heading east and west, leave between 06:30 and 07:30 in the morning.
Buses between the districts are often full, so it is advisable to buy a ticket in advance.
Most districts are travelled by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
Taxi-hailing services are a fast and convenient way to get to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a curved cable bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges
Your two towers are 83 metres high, their length is 378 metres and they have two lanes with 3,50 m width.
The bridge's height is 15 metres. The construction work was completed in August 2011, but the opening of the bridge was delayed until March 2017.
The bridge will be operational in September 2017. It is expected that the Brazilian customs checkpoints will be completed then.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group that inhabited the present-day eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also
The Chaco region was also the home of other indigenous groups, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering
Paraguay, formerly the province of West Indies, was named after the Spanish conquistadors who came together with the native indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began the colonization period, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for its polo team and its players to be among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place at Las Cañitas Polo fields in December.
Small tournaments and competitions can be watched here at any time of the year.
Informations on polo competitions and polo ticket outlets can be found at the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is set in accordance with the value of the British Pound
Money can be exchanged in the only bank on the island, which is located opposite the FIC West Store.
The British pound is generally accepted everywhere on the islands and at Stanley credit cards. Also US dollars are often accepted.
On the remote islands credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and American currencies can be accepted; ask the owners in advance which payment method is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland Islands' currency outside the islands themselves, so you should exchange your money before you leave the island.
As Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is there in summer when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the tropics. In the summer months, temperatures can reach over 30°C.
The winter can be misleadingly cold: the temperatures rarely fall below freezing point, but wind and humidity lead to a feeling of colder than what the thermometer shows.
There are no distinct wet or dry seasons: The amount of rainfall remains the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park have seen humans before, they are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authority, visitors should avoid at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals.
Even if Bisons, Wapitis, Elche, Bears and all the big animals can act peacefully, it can still happen that they turn on each other.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured, because they do not take enough space. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so leave them enough space.
Be aware that odours attract bears and other wild animals. Avoid carrying strong smelling food or cooking it and be careful about a clean storage area.
Apia is the capital of the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 18th century and is since 1959 the official capital of Samoa.
The port was the scene of a shameful stalemate in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships except one British warship were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans were killed.
While the Mau Movement was organising the independence struggle, a peaceful meeting in the city led to the killing of the chief of the Mau tribe Tupua Tamasese Le
There are many beaches in Auckland, and the most popular ones are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) lie on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south." #
Most of the beaches are sandy with safe swimming and most offer shade, which is provided by Pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located at the port of Waitemata, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central
There are family beaches, which are sometimes overcrowded, with a beautiful shopping promenade along the coast. Swimming is here safe.
The most important local beer is 'Number One'. It is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is 'Manta'
There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines are probably better tolerated.
Local tap water can be safely drunk, but if you are concerned about it, you will also find bottled water.
For Australians, the idea of coffee ""flat white"" is alien. A small black is ""espresso"" and a cappuccino is high with foam (not with milk) and tea is served without milk
Hot chocolate is Belgian standard. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many diving trips take place all year round and injuries caused by any of these causes are rare.
However, you should follow the Council's advice, all signs and particularly pay attention to security warnings.
Shrimps are common in the vicinity of beaches and in the vicinity of river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can also occasionally occur outside this
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and would run away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live in active waters, their primary habitat is in river mouths north of Rockhampton.
A reservation in advance gives the tourist the certainty that he will be able to find a place to stay when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although you may also book other accommodations, such as tents, through a travel agency.
Travel agents usually offer packages in which breakfast, transport to and from the airport or even a combination of flight and hotel are included.
You can also hold your reservation for you if you need time to reconsider the offer or to obtain further documents for your destination (e. g. a visa).
Any changes or requests should however be made first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
Many festivalgoers decide to camp out at the festival, and most visitors believe that this is an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you have to be early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that on some parts of the festival, music will continue to be played until late into the night, even though the music on the main stages has stopped.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the Baltic Sea in winter, check the state of the cabin, for the most affected by the ice breaking is quite a disturbing noise.
Cruises to St. Petersburg also offer time to visit the city. Passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos generally try very hard to keep guests for as long as possible and to spend as much money as possible. There are usually no windows or watches, and exits can be difficult to find.
You usually have a special offer for food, drinks and entertainment to keep the guests entertained and to ensure that they stay.
Some casinos offer alcoholic beverages for free. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good players know how important it is to remain sober.
If you want to drive over high mountains or over passes, you should be prepared for snow, ice and temperatures below freezing.
On icy and snowy roads, the liability is low and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
In very short time, so much snow can fall that you can get stuck.
The visibility can also be affected by falling or drifting snow or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, cold and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic runs all year round largely uninterrupted.
Safaris are probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
Safari is a term of art used in everyday language to refer to a trip to Africa to see the wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars, and the standard equipment makes it possible to see well." #
Lion, leopard and cheetah are often shy and you can observe them better with a telescope.
A bushwalk is a walk that lasts for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will take place at other venues in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Olympic Games, after having already hosted the Games in 1964.
If you have booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the rescheduling was announced, you could find yourself in a difficult situation.
The cancellation rules vary, but from late March most cancellation rules did not apply until July 2020, for the Olympic Games were to be held in that month.
It is estimated that most tickets will cost between 2,500¥ and 130,000¥, a typical ticket around 7,000¥.
Dry clothes can help to dry out. Many hotels provide irons and ironing boards, even if you are not present in the room.
If there is no iron available or you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can try to use a hairdryer if one is available." #
Be careful that the substance does not get too hot (it can shrink it or in extreme cases cause burns).
There are various methods for cleaning water. Some of them are more effective than others in preventing certain dangers.
In some areas, it is enough to boil water for a minute, in others it must be several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies greatly, and if you have any concerns, then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers can encounter animal pests from their home regions that they do not know.
Vermin can destroy food, cause irritation or even cause allergic reactions, give poison or transmit diseases.
Infections as such or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people are not usually classified as vermin.
Tax-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from duties and taxes at certain places.
Travellers, whose destination country has a high taxation, can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, particularly in the case of products such as alcoholic beverage
The section between Point Marion and Fairmount on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway is the most challenging driving section, as it often leads through remote, undeveloped terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: steep gradients, narrow roads and sharp curves prevail here.
The speed limits specified here are noticeably lower than those in the previous and following sections - usually between 35 and 40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict compliance with them is even more important than usual
However, interestingly, the mobile coverage here is much better than in many other areas of the route, for example, the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German bread is very tasty. In Bavaria, it is very rich and varied, as well as in Austria.
Fruit cake is widely used, with apples being boiled all year round and pears and plums being used in summer.
Many German cakes also contain nuts, almonds or other nuts. Popular cakes often go particularly well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want to produce small, but rich baked goods, then try this, which is referred to as Berliner, pancakes or crepes in different regions.
A curry is a dish that is based on herbs and spices, with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either dry or wet.
In the interior of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is usually used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is used
With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a catch-all term that encompasses a great variety of regional cuisines that can be found throughout the country
The term is used without further attributes, and usually refers to the food that originated in the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine, which is now widely spread throughout the archipelago, offers a variety of simple spiced dishes. As flavouring agents, the Javans prefer nuts, chilis, sugar (especially javan coconut sugar) and a number of aromatic
Stitching is a kind of footwear for the feet of the riders, which hang down from both sides of the saddle.
They give the horse more stability, but there are security concerns because the feet of the horse may get caught in them.
If a horse falls off its horse and gets caught on the stirrup, it can be pulled along if the horse passes. To minimise this risk, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
Firstly, most riders wear boots with a heel and a smooth, narrow sole.
In addition, some saddles, in particular English saddles, have safety buckles which allow the saddle to fall off when it is pulled back by a falling rider after it has been jerked forward by a falling rider.
The Cochamó Valley - Chile's most important climbing destination, known as the Yosemite National Park of South America, with a large number of large granite walls and -cliffs.
The summits offer a breathtaking view. Climbers from all over the world discover new routes along the walls, which offer endless opportunities.
Departure sports such as skiing and snowboarding are popular sports in which one attaches skis or a snowboard to his feet and descends over a snow covered slope.
Skiing is a popular holiday activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski-penners", who plan their entire holiday around skiing at a particular place.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depicting skiers go back to 5000 B.C.
The origins of skiing as a sport go back at least to the 17th century and in 1861 the first ski club in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Skitouring with pack: This activity is also known as ski touring or ski walking.
It resembles alpine skiing or mountaineering, but it does not necessarily include it, as it is carried out in steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis
Look at the skiing route as a comparable hiking route.
In good conditions you can walk longer distances than you would on a well-maintained ski slope - very rarely you will reach the speed of skiing on a well-maintained slope without a heavy pack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries. Normally you would have to apply for multiple visas and go through multiple passport controls if you want to travel through several countries.
The Schengen area works in this respect however a little like a country.
So long as you remain within this zone, you can usually cross borders without having to go through the passport control again.
According to the new rules, you will not have to apply for a separate Schengen visa for each of the Schengen Member States, which saves time,
There is no universally accepted definition of what constitutes an antique. Some tax authorities define over 100 years old goods as antiquities.
The definition has geographical deviations, where the age limit may be lower in regions such as North America than in Europe.
Handcrafted products could be described as 'antique', even though they are younger than similar products produced in mass production.
The reindeer breeding industry is a major source of livelihood for the Sámi, and the culture around the trade is also of great importance for many who work in other professions.
In the past, not all Sámi have bred large numbers of reindeer, but have lived mainly from fishing, hunting and similar activities. Reindeer were kept as herding animals.
Today, many Sámi work in modern professions. Tourism is a major source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
In addition, the term ""Gypsy"" is often used by non-Roma as a derogatory term, since it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma.
If a country issues a travel warning for you to visit, your travel insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also consult the advice of other governments as your own. Their advice is aimed at their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may be confronted with other situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Conferences are merely a summary of the political situation in a country.
The views expressed are often superficial, general and oversimplified in comparison to the more detailed information that can be found elsewhere.
Weather is the umbrella term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of human life.
Floods can occur anywhere in the world and there are different types of them, depending on the geography, topography and the atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall and forest fires are forms and effects of weather phenomena, as well as thunderstorms, tornado

Travellers are strongly advised to be on the lookout for any type of weather that affects their area, as this will have an impact on all travel plans
Everyone planning to travel to a country which is a war zone should have a professional training for that.
A search for ""course on hostile environments"" will probably display the address of a local company.
A course covers all the problems discussed in this discussion generally much more in-depth, usually combined with practical experience.
A course is usually between 2 and 5 days long and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
There are many books and journals on survival in the wilderness, but few publications on war zones.
Travellers planning to undergo a gender-switching operation abroad must ensure that they have valid travel documents for their return.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with a non-specified gender (X) or documents that have been updated to reflect the desired name and gender, is different.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognise these documents is also very different.
The searches at security checks have become more intrusive in the aftermath of 11 September 2001.
Transgender people should not expect that their privacy and dignity will be respected when passing through the body scanners.
Riss currents are the return current of broken waves, often at reefs or similar.
Because of the underwater topography, the return flow concentrates in a few deeper areas and a fast current can form there.
Many of these deaths occur as a result of exhaustion trying to swim against the current, which proves to be impossible.
If you leave the current, it is not difficult to return.
You should try to get somewhere where you are not caught. Alternatively, if you were noticed, you might wait for rescue.
The shock of return is earlier than the shock of culture shock (the honeymoon phase is not as pronounced), lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travellers who were able to adapt easily to the new culture find it difficult to adapt to their own culture.
When you return home after a long-term stay abroad, you have adapted to a different culture and have abandoned some of the behaviours of your home culture.
As you first travelled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding because they knew that travellers had to adapt to a new country.
Man might not expect that returning travellers should be treated with patience and understanding.
The sound and light show at the Pyramids is one of the most interesting attractions for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and while it is still quiet before the show begins.
Normally, one hears the sounds of tourists and sellers. The history of noise and light is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is used as a background and narrator of a long history.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids, and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The Southern Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most stations. In 2020, there were sixteen active
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
More islands are Livingston Island and Deception, where the overflowing caldera of a still active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbour.
Ellsealand is the region south of the Bellingshausen Sea that is bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula rise here and then fall again, forming the 360 km long chain of Ellsworth mountains which is divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains of the Antarctic, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak is the Mount Vinson, which has a height of 4
In remote areas without mobile coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is not a substitute for a mobile phone, as you must be in clear sight of a satellite to make a call.
The service is often used by ships, including pleasure boats, as well as expeditions that require data and voice links.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide further information about the connection to this service.
An ever-popular option for people who are planning to take a year off is study and course offerings abroad.
This is particularly popular among university graduates, as it allows them to take a year off without affecting their studies.

In general, fees are charged for these educational programmes.
Finland is a great destination for boat tours. The "land of thousand lakes" has also thousands of islands – in the lakes and in the archipelagoes
You do not need a yacht for the archipelagos and lakes.
In addition, even though the coastal island groups and the largest lakes are actually big enough for every boat, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience." #
Boating is the national pastime in Finland, one in six or eight owns a boat.
This is a very similar situation to that of Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the ratio is one for
Most Eastbound cruises include a longer stay in St. Petersburg in Russia.
That means that you can visit the historical city for several whole days while you are staying there and sleeping on the ship.
If you only go on a tour of the countryside, you do not need a separate visa (Stand 2009).
Some cruises offer Berlin as a destination in Germany in their brochures. You can see on the map above that Berlin is far from the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of a cruise.

More to know about the workings of aircraft and the processes that take place during a flight can help some to overcome their fear of the unknown or the feeling of not having control.
Courier companies are well paid for the fast delivery of things. Often, the time is an extremely important factor in corporate documents, trade goods or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the larger companies use their own aircraft, but on other routes and for smaller companies, difficulties occurred.
If they sent things via air freight, the loading and customs clearance could take several days on some routes.
The only way to get it done quicker was to send it as a baggage." The airline regulations do not allow passengers to send luggage without a passenger, and you come in to play.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay a hefty sum of money for the privilege.
But that is not cheap: As a rough guide, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business and the quadruple for first class!
It is pointless to look for discounts on direct flights from A to B even if you are looking for discounts for business or first class seats.
Airlines know very well that there is a certain core group of passengers who are prepared to pay a lot of money to get to their destination quickly and conveniently and demand appropriate prices.
The capital of Moldova is Kishinev. The native language is Romanian, but many people speak Russian.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
This conflict led to the formation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
In spite of the failure of the political negotiations, economic relations between these two parts of the Republic of Moldova were restored.
The most important religion in Moldova is the Christian Orthodox.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transport hub.

Please treat this place with the respect, reverence and respect it deserves. Don’t make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not vandalise the site by painting or scratching graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants speak Catalan more often, the majority understand it, and almost everyone can speak Spanish.
Most of the signs are however only in Catalan, because it is legally established as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other public services.
Normal announcements are made in the Metro only in Catalan, but unforeseen disturbances are reported by an automatic system in a variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are said to be arrogant, egotistical and rude.
Although this is often only a misleading stereotype, one finds oneself in Paris best at ease if one displays one’s best self and behaves like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-bred). This will make it easier to get by.
The rough exterior of Paris disappears very quickly, if you put basic manners to work.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, there are mainly oak, fir and pine and it offers a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
He has a remarkably diverse microclimate, a variety of soils and different altitudes, and this diversity of plant communities is a great asset.
The area is also home to a very large variety of animal and bird species.
There are rare fauna such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, foxes, wild cats and hens, as well as many more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts that reach up to the knees and they must cover their shoulders.
In most monasteries there are no diapers for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially a brightly coloured one, the monk or nun at the gate will smile at you.
In this respect, men should wear trousers that reach below the knees.
Also, this can be borrowed from the stock, but the clothes will not be washed after each user, so you may not feel comfortable in these shirts.

Ancient observatories are no longer in operation and are used as museums or educational centres.
Given that light pollution during its peak period did not pose a problem that it does today, they are usually found in cities or on university grounds that are easier to reach than those built in recent times.
Most modern astronomical observatories are colossal structures in remote regions with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Hanami is a traditional Japanese custom that dates back to the 8th century.

All animals that came originally to the islands by swimming, flying or drowning here.
Because of the great distance from the continent, mammals were not able to travel, which made the giant tortoise the main grazing animal on the Galapagos Islands.
