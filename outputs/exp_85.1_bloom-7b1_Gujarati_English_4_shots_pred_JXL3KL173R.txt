But the basic population has not changed much, they still need the same kind of amenities.
Over time, new populations become more acclimated to their new environment, they become less and less visible.

Siamese primates, like humans, have a digestive system that is not well suited to the amino acid requirements of plants.
And that will have serious consequences too: growth depression, malnutrition and ultimately death.
However, the most readily available plant resources are the leaves and seeds, but if they are cooked, they are not easily digestible for humans.
Contrary to this, animals are not only easy to digest but also provide high quality protein that is rich in all the essential amino acids.

traffic flow is the study of individual drivers and vehicles movement which is 2 points apart and it interacts with each other.
But unfortunately, traffic flow prediction is difficult because the driver's behavior cannot be predicted with a certainty of more than one hundred percent.
So, drivers are generally consistent in their speed; therefore, the traffic flow is moderate and can be mathematically represented as a little bit.
Three main characteristics of traffic flow are as follows: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These ties will help in planning, designing and management of road infrastructure.
