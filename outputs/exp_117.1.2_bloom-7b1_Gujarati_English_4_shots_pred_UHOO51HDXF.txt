These new environments are different from the previous ones, and therefore, the new generation will need to be stronger competitors than the previous ones, who had to cope with different resources or conditions.
However, the basic population has not changed much, and they still need the same kind of support.
In time, new populations will become accustomed to their new environment, and they will become less and less visible.
Finally, thousands or millions of years later, two distinct populations of animals will look alike so they cannot be considered the same species.

Plants have a very different digestive system from humans and therefore are unable to meet the amino acid needs of primates.
Therefore, failure to address the issue can lead to serious consequences such as growth depression, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The easiest to access plant resources are the seeds and the shells but if they are cooked they are not easily digestible for us humans.
Contrary to this, insects (beetles, ants, cockroaches) are not easy to eat but they provide a high quality protein that is rich in all the essential amino acids.
