The American Gymnastics Federation supports the letter of the United States Olympic Committee and accepts the absolute necessity of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We are in agreement with the statement of the USOC (United States Olympic Committee) that our athletes and clubs, as well as their sport, could be better served. This can be done by going forward and instead of changing significant things within our organisation, that is to revoke accreditation.

It confirms not only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already very widespread, but provides details that the fossils cannot usually provide, such as the colour and the three-dimensional arrangement.
The scientists say that this bird's plumage was brown-tan on the top and pale or carotened on the bottom.
This discovery also allows us to better understand the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a fully developed root, which is called a tail, but show other characteristics peculiar to feathers – beaks and barbels – the researchers have concluded that the tail was probably an evolutionary development later on.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight but rather for regulation or display of temperature.
The scientists say it is certainly a juvenile tail, but the sample reveals a feather belonging to an adult, and not to a juvenile.

The assistant inspector general D. K. Arya said: "We have arrested five people for violating the Swiss citizen, and we have recovered her phone and her laptop.
The defendants are called Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the police commissioner, said that the people accused had their faces covered when they appeared before the court.
While three people were present in the house when the car hit it, no one was injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured to the head.
The road where the accident took place was temporarily closed to allow the emergency services to extract the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrookes Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son by the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is in custody awaiting trial and her arrest, but eyewitness testimony could be compromised because her portrait has been widely circulated.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but the Scottish justice system operates differently and the courts have considered that publishing photographs was potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, of Dundee University, notes that "journalists seem to follow a dangerous line if they publish photos, etc. of suspects.
The Crown Prosecution Service has said to journalists that no further comment will be made at least until the prosecution is brought.
According to the leak, the document will deal with the dispute at the border that the Palestinians claim on the basis of the pre-1967 borders.
The other topics discussed include the future State of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of ten years from the signing of an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority only agrees to a period of five years.
The shooters of the additional parasite control trial had to be closely monitored by rangers, as the trial was being controlled and its effectiveness being assessed.
In the context of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) inc., qualified volunteers have been recruited, in the context of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, temporary conservator of the park and heritage, the four shooters named for the first killing campaign were properly trained and instructed in safety procedures.
Martelly has intronized yesterday a new provisional Electoral Council (CEP) consisting of nine members.
It is the fifth GSP of Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee recommended the dissolution of the previous CEP in the context of a set of measures aimed at engaging the country on a new path towards elections.
This committee was the response of Martelly to the widespread protests against his regime that began in October.
The violent protests sometimes took place because there were no elections, which were due to take place in 2011.
About 60 iPods have been reported overheating, resulting in six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has said that it had been informed of 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, the METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which it had described as 'not serious'.
The Ministry has responded by saying it is'really regrettable' that the report has been postponed by Apple.
The earthquake struck the Mariannes at 7:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The Emergency Management Office of the Northern Mariana Islands has stated that no damage has been reported in this country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman has taken hostages in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, by diverting a bus to Manila.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six of them have been confirmed to have been killed so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released prematurely, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the loo. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and decided to become a doctor.
He followed a training course in obstetrics, and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When he was working at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature births during his free time. 
His research has shown that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the pulmonary maturation of the baby.
The Chinese news agency Xinhua reported that the government's investigators recovered two black boxes (or "black boxes") on Wednesday.
Other fighters also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. A unique moment, just like her. A strong woman.
Dustin 'Goldust' Runnels commented that 'Luna was as strange as me... or even more so... I love her and she will be missed... I hope she rests in a better place.'
A survey conducted among 1,400 people before the federal elections of 2010 revealed that the number of opponents to the transformation of Australia into a republic had increased by 8 % since 2008.
The interim prime minister, Julia Gillard, during the 2010 federal election campaign said she thought Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 per cent of those questioned share this view, and wish that Queen Elizabeth II is the last monarch to reign over Australia.
At the extremes of the poll, 29 per cent of those questioned think that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 per cent think that Australia should never become a republic.
The gold medallist was due to swim in 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical condition was put under doubt.
He could not take the necessary medicines to overcome his pain, these being banned within the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer scientist at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest known prime number.
Many people have checked the discovery using different equipment and software at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
The comets may have been a source of water for the earth, as well as organic matter which can form proteins and promote life.
The scientists hope to understand how planets form, and in particular how the Earth formed, because comets have collided with it for a long time.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, 53, began his term in January and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He has described the rumours as 'talking and political nonsense'.
We think he will be the next President of the Council.
According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that would allow aircraft to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, reducing carbon emissions.
It is based on satellite technology, and not on ground-based radar systems, which enables air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and to provide pilots with more detailed information.
The additional transport is non-existent and the surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and the parking and relay sites are not available on the ground.
The fear of not having enough transport has led to the possibility that the match could be played in closed doors, without the supporters of the teams.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science has reported the emergence of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and the University of Uppsala in Sweden have indicated that the new species had evolved in only two generations, although this process has been estimated to have taken much longer, following the breeding between a Darwin's finch endemic, Geospiza fortis, and the finch immigrant, Geospiza conirostris.
You can shape gold in many ways. It can be rolled into tiny pieces.
It may be twisted and braided, or hammered and laminated into sheets.
It can be made very fine, and glued onto another metal. It can be so fine that it has sometimes been used to decorate hand-painted images in manuscripts called "enlumined manuscripts.
That is the pH of a chemical. You can make a pH indicator out of carrot juice.
The cucumber juice changes colour according to the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the chemical tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electron (because hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron)." #
Mix the dry powders together, then, with clean hands and moist ones, press them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the external layers, which will produce a strange sensation and produce a sort of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets equipped with a flush in almost all houses, connected to a sophisticated sewage
Remains of sewer systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, in Persia and China. In Roman times, public baths sometimes included toilets where men and women could mingle.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
Satellite receives the call in space, and then returns to Earth almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts a part of our light and our vision.
We need a giant rocket of more than 30 meters high to put a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in many ways. The greatest benefit it has brought us is to make transport much simpler and faster.
It brought us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Below are medium-sized cats which eat smaller prey, including rabbits, deer and other cattle.
In addition, there are many small cats (including free-roaming cats) who eat the smaller prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a task specially allocated to each feline, preventing it from competing with other.
The lions are the most sociable cats, living in large groups called herds.
The herds are composed of one to three adult males, as well as a 30 to 40 females and cubs.
Women are generally very close to one another, their family being made up of a large number of sisters and daughters.
The lions act like packs of wolves or dogs, animals that are very similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in their behaviour, and also very deadly for their prey.
Balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (but sometimes difficultly), swim, jump great distances and pull with five times the strength of a human powerful.
The tiger is part of the same family (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones capable of roaring.
The roar of the tiger does not sound like the roar of the lion, but rather like a phrase whose words would be cries and groans.
Ocelot are fond of small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all animals that ocelot hunt are much smaller than him.
According to scientists, ocelots sniff out prey (prey) by smelling their tracks on the ground.
They see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision, and they move also very stealthily. The ocelots hunt their prey by blending into their environment before leaping on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it is derived (for example, if it moves above a mountain range or river, or if it moves to a new island so that it cannot easily return to its former location), it often finds itself in a different environment than it was previously.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so that the new population will need new characteristics or adaptations to be a powerful competitor against what it had before.
The population of origin has not changed at all, it still needs the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they will no longer be considered to be part of the same species.
We call this process "speciation", which simply means the formation of new species. It is an inevitable and very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, exhale).
Plants produce their food by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The giant squid was the superpredator of the time, and it did not fear anything, except other giant squid.
His long, razor-sharp teeth were equipped with more than 70 sharp teeth, as well as a series of additional teeth in the palate, so that anything that crossed his path could not escape.
We don’t know for sure, but it may have been a bit tongue-tied. His diet included large fish, other plesiosaurs, and it may even have been cannibal.
He also attacked everything that went into water, even a dinosaur like a T. rex was not big enough against him.
While the Romans ate food that we know, they also ate strange or unusual dishes, including deer, pheasants, snails and cockroaches, as well as the hare, a sort of rodent.
Another difference: while the poor and the woman ate their food sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to organise banquets where they rested on the side while they ate.
Roman meals of antiquity could not include these foods from America or Asia which have been introduced into Europe centuries later.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Romans have ever tasted pork.
The Babylonians built temples for each of their gods, and each was regarded as the god's dwelling place.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivities.
Each temple had a courtyard, then a inner sanctum, which only priests could enter.
Some pyramidal towers, ziggurats, were sometimes built as part of a temple.
The summit of the tower was a special place for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
The bulk of the Jewish family life was outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were open only counters, giving on the street. Houses were built in stones. 
As there were no great forests in Canaan, the timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In Scandinavian sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and found Greenland — and named it — on his travels further west.
But apart from its discovery, the Eskimos lived there already at that time.
While each country is'scandinavian', there are many differences between the people, the kings, the customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the film Benjamin Gates and the Templar Treasure, you may well think that a treasure map has been drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that is not true. Although there is a stamp on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Independence Declaration, it read: ‘Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776’. The text is on the bottom of the document, reversed.
While nobody knows who wrote it, we know that at an early stage of its existence, the great scroll (which measures approximately 29 inches three quarters on 24 inches) was rolled up. 
It is therefore likely that the rating was added simply as an add-on.
The landing day and the subsequent battles freed the north of France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by Frenchmen who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupying power instead of facing it.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies landed in the south of France, an invasion called Operation "Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French Forces had liberated the south of France and were heading for Germany.
A civilisation is a unique culture shared by a large number of people who live and work in cooperation, a society.
The word 'civilisation' derives from the Latin word 'civis', which means civil and is related to the Latin words 'civis', which means citizen, and 'civitas', which means city or state and which also indicates, in some way, the size of the society to which it relates.
Cities-states are the pioneers of nations. A culture civilisational involves the transmission of knowledge on several generations, a durable cultural marking and an equitable distribution.
Minority cultures are often lost without leaving any historically relevant traces and are not recognised as genuine civilisations.
In the revolutionary war, the thirteen States first formed a weak central government — the Congress being its only component — under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes and, as there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on the authorities of the State, often less cooperative, to enforce all its acts.
He did not have the power to derogate from tax laws or from customs duties between states.
The articles required unanimous consent of all Member States before they could be amended and Member States took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, with Germany's national team, the second most successful team in the world and they have won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
In popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, equestrian, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1.
Skiing is the most popular sport in the northern regions, Italians taking part in international and Olympic events.
Japan has more than 7 000 islands (the largest being Honshu), which makes it the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the group of islands that make up it, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago.
The first information about Taiwan comes from the 15th century, while European sailors passing through the area made mention of it under the name of Formosa, or 'beautiful island'.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the south-west of Taiwan, introducing a transformation of the local practices of rice production and employing Chinese workers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared them as part of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the first Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing Government signed the Shimonoseki Treaty, by which it ceded Taiwan to Japan, which was then in charge of Taiwan until 1945.
The Machu Picchu is made up of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the sun temple and the three-window room.
Most of the buildings adjacent to the complex have been rebuilt to provide better views of their original appearance.
In 1976, thirty per cent of the Machu Picchu had been restored and this restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format of photographic film is 35 mm; it was the most common format of film used at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still made today, but what is important is that its image format is inherited from the image sensor format of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually, and it is quite surprising, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
So we say that the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest of integer ratios) is 3:2.
Many common formats (APS family, for example) are equal to this aspect ratio or are close to it.
The third rule, which is often ridiculed and abused, is a simple directive which offers a dynamic and a protection image.
It indicates that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the vertical and horizontal lines dividing the image (see example).
In this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was being questioned.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has bound the European States together despite the differences in language and customs.
His omnipresence touched everyone, from the king to the roturier.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to relieve suffering and poverty and that the church's money is there specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the church was in Rome for more than 1000 years and this concentration of power and money has led many people to ask whether this doctrine was respected.
. – After the start of hostilities, Great Britain put in place a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategy has proved effective, cutting vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade has been flagrantly violating the generally accepted and codified international law by several international agreements of the last two centuries.
The United Kingdom is attempting to block international waters in order to prevent ships from venturing into entire areas of international waters, which represents a threat even to neutral ships.
As this tactic has not elicited a timid reaction, Germany expected a similar reaction in the face of its underwater war without limits.
In the 20th century, most citizens and nations showed a preference for pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, nations wished to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four hundred dollars in his name, a poem and a recommendation letter from Charles Batchelor (his previous employer) to Thomas Edison.
The ancient Chinese had a unique way of showing the different periods of China or each family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
The dynasties that followed each other also had a period of unstable provinces. The most famous of these periods is the Three Kingdoms period that lasted for 60 years between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty.
In these periods, fierce battles have been fought between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms were one of the bloodiest periods in the history of Chinese ancient history. Thousands of people died in battle to sit on the throne of the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political repercussions such as the adoption of the metric system, the passing of absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people and not to one single leader.
As well, after the Revolution, all professions were open to all male candidates, enabling the most ambitious and the most talented to succeed.
It is the same for the army, because the ranking of armies is no longer based on the class, but on the calibre.
The French Revolution also inspired many other working-classes in other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions that transcended the worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that became famous under the name of 'Hira' on the mountain of 'Noor' (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived to the time, gives a very vivid picture of the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
Set at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
 " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " 
Over there, you can't see anything else but the clear sky and the many mountains surrounding it. From the inside of the cave, you can't see or hear anything else from this universe.
The Great Pyramid of Gizeh is the only of the seven wonders that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians during the third millennium BC, one of many gigantic structures erected in honour of the Pharaohs who had died.
The Giza plateau, or 'Giza necropolis', in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, contains several pyramids (the largest being the most imposing), several small tombs, many temples and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built to honour the pharaoh Khéops, and many small pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honour his wives and his family.
The symbol 'push' looks like a V and the symbol 'pull' looks like a square with a missing bottom.
The high means that you must start with the tip and push the bow, and the low means that you must start with the arrow and pull the bow.
A bow upwards produces a softer sound, while a bow downwards produces a louder sound.
Don't be afraid to write your own marks on the pencil, but remember that printed arch-tipped marks are for a musical reason, and you should therefore generally respect them.
On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, his wife Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old), and the sister of the king, Madame Elisabeth, all terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by
In a carriage, they went back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and screamed threats against the king and the queen.
The king and queen were forced to open the windows of their carriages because of the crowd.
At one point a crowd member brandished the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles before the terrified queen.
The US imperialist war expenditures in the Philippines have been paid for by the people of the Philippines themselves.
They were forced to pay colonial US taxes to cover a large part of the expenses and interest of the Philippine government bonds issued by Wall Street banks.
Of course, the superprofits that result from prolonged American imperialism could be the fundamental benefits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context in which they were created.
These events took place during the period generally considered to be the High Middle Ages – a period of European history from the eleventh to the thirteenth century (1000-1300).
The Central Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Low Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from the technological push or the imperative to a strict sense of which the destiny of humanity is determined by a logical underpinning linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technological developments.
The majority of interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: technological development itself is a process that transcends cultural and political influences, and technology has an impact on societies that are intrinsically conditioned rather than socially.
For example, one could say that the automobile is a necessary condition for road development.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a few cars, so new methods of production are developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Massive ownership of cars also leads to an increased incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the field of health care for treating the body injuries.
Romanticism presented a very important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
According to Romantic theories, geography has shaped individuals and, over time, customs and a culture associated with this geography have emerged. These, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris is known as the capital of the world's fashionable capital, Constantinople was regarded as the capital of the European feudal age.
His reputation as the centre of luxury has started around the year 400 and lasted until 1100.
His status has declined over the twelfth century, mainly because of the fact that the Crusaders returned with presents such as silk and spices, which the Byzantine markets could not compete with.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its apogee between the 10th and 13th centuries.
At first, the dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture, east of the river.
However, due to the slowness of communication methods, western modes could accuse a delay of 25 to 30 years.
In the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time, following the crusades, was the use of buttons for closing clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is a farming practiced to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic system, using heirloom seeds from the region, combined with rotational farming or other simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers practised subsistence farming and that is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures are groups of people who feel neglected by social norms and share the same ideas which allows them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnic origin, class, location and / or sex of members.
The criteria that determine a subculture as distinct from the mainstream can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
Subculture members often signal their membership by distinctive and symbolic use of style, which encompasses fashion, manias, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on a few unfortunate cases of children who, by neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse, have not been socialized by adults during their childhood.
These children are considered to be 'wild' or'savage'. Some children who were 'wild' were locked up by people (usually their own parents) ; in some cases, the abandonment of this child was due to the rejection by parents of a severe intellectual or physical disability which the child suffered.
Wild children may have suffered serious abuse or trauma before being abandoned or escaping.
Others would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in the wild.
When they are raised entirely by non-human species, wild children display almost identical behaviours (in the limits of their physical capacities) to those of the species that raised them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
As the project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the support goes further.
Support is not a method of learning but rather a means of helping learners who discover a new teaching such as the use of a new programme or the beginning of a new project.
Supports can be both virtual and real. In other words, a professor is a form of support, but the little Microsoft Office trombone is also one.
Virtual scaffolding is integrated into the software and are intended to interrogate, guide and explain procedures that would have been too difficult to manage for the student alone.
Children are placed in foster homes for very diverse reasons, which range from neglect to maltreatment, from extortion to bribery.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, attentive and educational, but it is the case.
We perceive family placement as a security zone for these children.
Our family placement system is supposed to provide safe, caring, stable education and reliable health care.
The placement in family homes is supposed to provide all the necessities which were lacking in the home from which they had previously been removed.
Internet combines mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of user approaches and gratifications.
For example, 'learning' and'socialisation' are seen as major factors promoting Internet use (James et al., 1995).
'Personal involvement' and 'continuous relationships' have also been identified as being new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied public reactions to internet sites.
Video recording has led to great discoveries in the interpretation of facial expressions, that is, facial expressions during a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect if a person is lying by interpreting correctly micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, has explained how people with cerebral lesions are still able to assess the sincerity of the speech.
He suggests that such human behaviour interpretation abilities may be found in domestic dogs.
The research of the twentieth century has shown that there are two genetic reservoirs: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and the selection removes it from the reserve of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination alternate between the two river basins at each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet its nutritional needs from the available plant resources.
In addition, a lack of response has serious consequences: growth disorders, malnutrition and ultimately, death.
The most easily accessible plant proteins would be those contained in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult to digest for us, unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest and provide a large amount of essential amino acids.
In all fairness, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors have solved their 'protein problem' in a similar way that chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep deprivation is the process of intentional awakening during your sleep and subsequently falling asleep within a few minutes.
It can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock, so that you can wake up without waking up completely.
If you reset the clock while you are asleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get up to turn it off.
Other possibilities based on the biorhythm include drinking a lot of liquids before going to bed (particularly water or tea, reputed to be diuretics), which forces you to wake up to go to the toilet.
The degree of inner peace of a person opposes the degree of tension in his body and his mind.
More the tension is low, the more the present life force is positive. Each person has the possibility to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way is our own tension and our negativeness.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been enriched by the path of love mahayana and by many techniques of yoga from India.
In principle, the Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the universal love path.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (illumination energy) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
Tibetan Buddhist meditation centers are the yoga of the deity. It is through visualizing different deities that the channels of energy are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of awakening is created.
Germany was a common enemy during the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, deep conflicts between their different systems, methods and cultures ended the cooperation between these two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies have become enemies and the Cold War has begun.
It would last for the next 40 years and see real battles, through proxy armies, on battlefields in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defence was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganise along the Romanian head of the bridge.
But these plans have become obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800 000 Soviet soldiers arrived and created the Bieloruss-Ukrainian front after invading the eastern parts of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, as well as other international treaties, whether bilateral or multilateral, whether they are bilateral or multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The work of the armed forces has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the capacity to move your people and your goods, while interfering with your enemy's capacity to move his people and his goods.
One of the most recent examples of this situation was the campaign North Atlantic during World War II. The Americans were trying to cross the Atlantic Ocean to help the British.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly U-boats, tried to stop this trade.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as it has done for the rest of Europe.
It seems that the sheep have been domesticated for the first time about 10 000 years ago in the Zagros mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribal groups began to keep them close to them to have easy access to milk, fur, meat and skins.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds which wandered on hills or other pastures, often cared for by shepherds who were most often children or adolescents, similar to the more familiar term of shepherds.
The 'wagonways' were built in England in the fifteenth century.
While the railway tracks were simply made of parallel planks of wood, they allowed horses to pull them faster and carry heavier loads than on the slightly more accident-prone roads of the day.
The crossbars were introduced early enough to keep the tracks in place. However, it was soon apparent that the tracks would be more effective if they were provided with a steel bar on top.
It has become a common practice, but iron has caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails were introduced.
The first means of locomotion was walking: humans began to walk upright about two million years ago with the arrival of the Homo Erectus ("right-handed man").
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as they usually did.
There are bipedal specializations in the fossils of Australopithecus afarensis from 4,2 to 3,9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs already seven million years ago.
We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even lobby for the purpose of mitigating the sufferings to come.
In many cases, it is a symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not want just a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems and disable them.
It is clear that the world has changed greatly thanks to the scientific and technological advances made by human beings, and that the problems have become more serious because of the overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a draft signed by the Congress's president John Hancock and Charles Thomson was then sent to a few blocks away, to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
Over the course of the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, known as 'Dunlap Broadsides'.
The first reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the Independence Hall courtyard on 8 July.
One of them was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who read it to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy reached London on 10 August.
The 25 sheets Dunlap that we know of are the oldest copies of the document. The original manuscript has not survived.
Many palaeontologists now believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive. They are called birds.
Many people regard them as dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly.
But there are still a lot of birds that look like a dinosaur.
They have claws on their feet and they lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like T-Rex.
In practice, all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in binary form.
A binary number can only have one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary numbers, or bits to use the computer jargon.
An internal poisoning can not be seen immediately. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are sufficiently general to allow a prompt diagnosis to be made.
The best indicator of an internal poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of household chemicals or drugs that are toxic.
See the label for the specific first aid instructions for this poison.
The term 'bug' is used by entomologists in a formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
The term 'bed bug' derives from an old familiarity with bed bugs, which are very adapted to parasitising humans.
The maggots, like bed bugs, are nidicolous, that is to say they are adapted to live in the nest or the host's home.
In the United States, there are approximately 400 000 known cases of MS, making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease which affects the central nervous system, consisting of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis than men.
A couple can very well estimate that it is not in their interest, nor in the child’s, to take care of the education of a baby.
These couples can choose to adopt a baby.
In adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main objective of science is to understand how the world works through scientific methodology. This method guides in fact most scientific research.
But it is not the only experiment, and an experiment is a test that serves to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, pose questions and make observations, but also orients research.
Naturalists and philosophers have concentrated on the ancient texts, and in particular on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were accepted.
With the decline of Greek knowledge, Western civilization has been cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the observed rhythms in physiology and behaviour are often dependent on the presence of endogenous clocks and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to periodic external stimuli, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators which will continue to operate for a certain period even without external stimulation.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the principal indications that DNA was a material genetic.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacteria.
They have conducted two experiments to mark either the phage RNA with a radioactive phosphorus, or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the extent of the genetic material affected and if the affected cells are germ cells.
Only germline mutations can be passed on to children, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism is aimed at people who want to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, including wildlife and flora.
Hunting, fishing, bird watching, photographing, observing birds, visiting parks and studying the information on the ecosystem are examples of activities on the ground.
You can go and see, photograph and discover the orang-utans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the countryside towns in their cars to go to their place of work and cross other people who are going to work in the countryside they have just left.
In this dynamic transport system, each is connected to a vehicle-based transport system and supports it.
The science now shows that this massively carbon-based economy has pushed the biosphere out of its stable state that supported human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries it is rare to hear so many complaints about the quality of the water or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they break down every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flows are the study of the movements of drivers and vehicles between two points, and the interactions they exert between themselves.
It is difficult to study the flow of traffic because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with a hundred per cent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act within a reasonable range; so, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable range and can be represented mathematically approximatively.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) the volume, (2) the density and (3) the speed.
These relationships help to plan, design and operate road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly enabled them to escape more easily from their enemies and to find more effectively food and companions.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their bodies.
It gives them more places to hide from predators.
Today, only dragonflies and those that can't fold their wings are exempt.
There are some 6,000 years ago, a man called Aristotle said that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many thought the opposite: that the solar system moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
It seems sensible, because the Earth does not seem to be moving, is that not?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times the volume of water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the world's largest river, reaching up to 10 kilometres wide.
At least 20 percent of the water that falls from rivers on the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River arm is 6 387 km (3 980 miles). It collects the water of thousands of small rivers.
While the construction of pyramids continued up to the end of the Old Kingdom, the Great Pyramid of Gizeh never surpassed its size and the technical perfection of its construction.
Ancient Egyptians were astonished by the monuments of their predecessors, who had then been in existence for more than a thousand years.
The Vatican has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and the least populated.
Vatican City drafts its legislation and its official communications in Italian.
Italian is also the language of everyday use by most of the people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
The citizens of the Holy City of Rome are all Catholics.
From antiquity, people have been familiar with basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, because they are found in nature in their pure form and are relatively simple to mine using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, has theorised that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. It was earth, water, air and fire.
It was more about the four states of matter (in the same order) : solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although he also made the theory that these latter would transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered as metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys which contain a small amount of non-metal elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of minuscule particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that billions of them could enter the period at the end of this sentence.
So, pencil was a good friend to many people when it was released.
It is unfortunate that the appearance of new modes of writing has relegated the pen to a more confidential status and has become less common.
People are now writing messages on computers screens, without ever having to touch a pencil.
It is only natural to wonder what the keyboard will become when the next new thing comes along.
Nuclear fission works on the principle that it combines energy by combining a nucleus of a myriad of protons and neutrons.
Like if you were to make the hill climb by a heavy cart. Dividing the core again, and then letting some of that energy out.
Some atoms have a highly unstable nucleus, so that they tend to break up with little or no pressure.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust. Its outer layer is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the visible side and 100 km on the hidden side.
She is thinner at sea level and thicker under the continents.
There may be more lava on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are concerned with the search for what makes people feel good or attracted.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they matured into adulthood.
These theories examine what drives some people to want what they do and what drives their environment to do or not do what they do.
Two popular content theories are the Maslow's hierarchy of needs and the two-factor theory of Herzberg.
Generally speaking, two behaviours can emerge when a manager becomes the boss of former colleagues. One extreme is to try to stay 'the good friend' (or 'the good girlfriend').
A manager of this type is not very good at taking difficult decisions, carrying out disciplinary actions, carrying out evaluations, and delegating responsibilities, and holding others responsible.
At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes a person who is unrecognizable who feels that he/she must change everything that the group has created up to now and do things in his/her own way." #
After all, the boss is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behaviour often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical team.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet at different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
A real invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also an unique element of a virtual team.
The "invisible" team is the team of management to which each member reports. It establishes standards for each of them.
Why would an organisation want to create a structure of learning? One of the objectives linked to the implementation of organisational learning concepts is innovation.
When all the available resources are used efficiently in the functional services of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can be expressed fully.
Therefore, a process of working together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
Before an organisation can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and its own culture of learning.
Angel (2006) presents Continuum as a method used to help organizations achieve better results.
Neurobiological data provide material evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research. They therefore allow for a much more precise field of research.
The correlation between the brain disease and the behaviour supports scientists in their research.
We know for a long time that different types of damage, lesions, tumours and brain damage affect behaviour and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
It gives us a lot of information and material to build models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although Artificial Intelligence is often strongly associated with science-fiction, it is a very important part of computer science that studies the behaviour, learning and adapting intelligently of a machine.
Research in artificial intelligence is aimed at the automating of tasks requiring an intelligent approach.
The examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnostics and customer questions, as well as recognition of writing, voice and face.
The practices have led to distinctive disciplines, aimed at solving the everyday problems of people's lives.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and military, as it was used in many home computers and video games.
Excursions are integral to any school. Often, a teacher would like to take his pupils to places where a bus journey is not possible.
The solution is provided by the technology in the form of virtual educational excursions. Pupils can watch the ancient objects of a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a beautiful work of art while sitting in their class.
Participating practically to a trip is also a good way of thinking about a trip and of sharing your experiences with future generations.
For example, students at Bennett High School in North Carolina design and build a website each year about their visit to the capital of the state. Each year, the site is updated, but the old versions are kept online for use as an album.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Even if students often try blogging with poor grammar and spelling, the fact that they have a public makes it much easier to improve.
As students are often the most critical of the blog's author, he is beginning to work on his writing to avoid the criticism.
In addition, blogging "forces students to better understand the world around them". The need to stimulate public interest encourages students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are an instrument which stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
When used effectively, blogs can help students to strengthen their analytical and critical thinking skills: by responding to online content, they can confront their own opinions with those of others and expose their own points of view on specific topics.
Ottawa is the charming capital of Canada and has a large number of art galleries and museums which highlight the past and present of Canada.
You will find further south the falls of Niagara and further north, the Muskoka region and its environs which boast a virgin natural beauty.
All these measures, and many more, make Ontario what foreigners regard as the quintessence of Canada.
The large areas further north are sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited at the wild state.
For a more surprising comparison of the population: There are more African Americans living in the US than Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean, close to the African coast.
Madagascar is the largest country, and even a continent by itself, in terms of wildlife.
Most of the small islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known for being luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam into the islands and this religion has spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The European influence and colonialism began in the 14th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route that connects Europe to India.
North, the region is defined by the Sahara Desert and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
To women: It is recommended that any woman who travels should say that she is married, regardless of her marital status.
It is also advisable to wear an alliance (which should not seem too precious.
Women must realise that some cultural differences may lead to behaviours they regard as harassment. It is common for them to be followed, caught by the arm, etc.
Be firm in your refusal of men's advances, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural or not, that doesn't mean it's acceptable!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Medes as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese, who after destroying it had rebuilt it and renamed it Casa Branca, finally abandoned it in 1755 after a quake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city under the name of Daru l-Badya, and it was renamed Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in all of Morocco for shopping.
Around the old medina, you can easily find places where you can buy traditional Moroccan products, such as tajines, pottery, leather goods, and all kinds of jewellery, but it is all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano which buried most of the city's streets, in particular the city centre.
Although Goma is reasonably secure, all visits to the outside of Goma should be subject to checks to understand the state of the fighting in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of Nyiragongo volcano as well as for treks of tracking gorillas in the mountains of the least expensive in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motor taxi) to get around in Goma. The normal fare (local) is about 500 CDF for a small trip.
Combined with its relative remoteness, "Tombouctou" has become a metaphor for distant countries and exotic peoples.
Today, Tombouctou is a poor city, although its reputation as a tourist attraction has made it a popular destination.
In 1990, it was added to the list of threatened sites of world heritage, because of the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main steps in the PBS series 'African Wonders' by Henry Louis Gates.
The city contrasts greatly with the rest of the country, because it has a more Arab style than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The total area of the park is 19 500 km2, which is divided into 14 ecozones, each of which contains a specific fauna.
This is one of the most famous theme parks in South Africa and regarded as the crown jewel of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As for all South African national parks, there are daily entry fees and conservation rights.
It may be advantageous to obtain a Wild Card that gives access to some South African national parks, as well as all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the name given to the territory of Hong Kong and represents the main centre of interest for many tourists.
The row of buildings that forms the horizon of Hong Kong is compared to a shimmering bar chart, which is revealed by reflection in the Victoria harbour.
To admire the most beautiful panoramas of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to Kowloon's seafront located opposite.
The majority of the urban development of Hong Kong's northern peninsula is concentrated on the north-facing terraces.
This is the place that the British colonists have occupied. Thus, it seems to be a good starting point, if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this region.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest mangrove forest belt, extending for 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the hinterland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The forest area in India is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not only composed of mangrove swamps: they also contain some of the last vestiges of the majestic jungles that covered the plains of the Ganges once.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3 850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water/wetlands.
Sundarbans is a nature reserve since 1966, you will find there about 400 Bengal tigers and 30 000 spotted deer.
The buses leave the district bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, but most, especially those that serve the east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6 and 7 a.m.
Inter-district buses are often full, so it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese ships, comfortable and robust.
The shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to get to places such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock Bridge is a suspension bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to link the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint George in Guyana.
The two towers stand at a height of 83 metres; they are 378 metres long and have two 3 m wide lanes.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. The structure was completed in August 2011, but it was opened to traffic only in March 2017.
The bridge should be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs posts should be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group living in what is now the eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also practising subsistence farming.
Other tribes of indigenous peoples who populated the Chaco, such as the Guaycurú or the Payaguá, survived mainly by fishing, hunting, or gathering.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, once called 'the giant province of India', was born from the meeting between Spanish conquerors and the indigenous peoples.
The Spanish inaugurated the period of colonisation, which lasted for three centuries.
From the foundation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain a large part of its native character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best teams and among the best players in polo in the world.
The biggest polo tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
In addition, tournaments and matches of lesser magnitude are sometimes held here at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, see the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands Pound (FKP) which is equivalent to a pound sterling (GBP).
The money can be exchanged at the sole Stanley bank, located opposite the FIC West shop.
The pound is a widely accepted currency in the islands, while in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the nearby islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, even if it is possible that British and American dollars will be accepted. Talk to the owners in advance to agree on a payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange money from the Maldives outside the islands, so change it before you leave the islands.
Montevideo being located south of the Equator, the winter in the northern hemisphere corresponds to the summer there and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical zone and summer temperatures are often over 30 °C.
Winter can be misleadingly cold: temperatures rarely fall below zero, but wind and humidity combine to give the impression that it is colder than what the thermometer says.
There is no real season of 'wet' and 'dry': the rainfall is pretty constant all year round.
While many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, they are still wild animals; please do not feed them or disturb them.
According to the authorities of the park, you must stay at least 100 metres away from bears and wolves and at least 25 metres away from all other wild animals!
As they may appear to be docile, the bison, the reindeer, the lynx, and almost all the great animals can attack.
Each year, hundreds of visitors are injured because they do not keep a sufficient distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them some space.
In addition, know that odours attract wild animals, so avoid transporting or cooking odours and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of about 40 000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and is the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a tragic naval stalemate in 1889, when seven German, American and British ships refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, apart from a British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
The Supreme Head of the Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was assassinated during a peaceful gathering in the city, during the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement.
The beaches are numerous, because Auckland is on the edge of two harbours. The most popular ones are found in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the district of North Harbour) lie on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay to Devonport to the south.
Most of the beaches are sandy and allow safe swimming, and most are shaded by the Pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are on the Waitemata Harbour, in the chic Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in the centre of Auckland.
The beaches, which are often very frequented by families, have many shops along the coast. Swimming is safe there.
The main local beer is the 'Number One', a rather ordinary beer, but tasty and refreshing. There is also another local beer, the 'Manta'.
There are many French wines to taste, but the New Zealand and Australian wines will travel better.
You can drink the tap water without any danger, but you can easily find bottled water if you have any concerns about it.
For Australians, the idea of a 'coffee cream' is foreign. A black coffee is an 'espresso', a cappuccino is filled with cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is Belgian standard. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries caused by one of these causes on the reef are rare.
However, follow the advice of authorities, obey all signs and pay attention to warnings.
From October to April, north of 1770, the box jellyfish arrive near the beaches and river estuaries. They can also sometimes be seen outside this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most of them are afraid of humans and would run away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live in the ocean, their main habitat is in estuary rivers in north Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveller the peace of mind of knowing that he will have somewhere to sleep once he arrives at destination.
Travel agencies often have special agreements with specific hotels, but you can also book through travel agencies of other types of accommodation, such as camping sites.
Travel agencies usually offer packages including breakfast, transport from/to the airport or even packages combining flight and accommodation.
They can also retain your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or to procure other documents necessary for your destination (for example, a visa).
Any change or request must however be addressed to the travel agency first and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants decide to camp on site, and most consider that this is an integral part of the experience.
If you want to be a part of the musical event, you will have to arrive early to find a good camping site.
Don't forget that even if the music shows are over on the main stages, other music shows can continue until late at night on other sites of the festival.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the north of the Baltic in winter, be sure to check the location of the hut, as the crossing of the ice may cause unbearable noise at the most exposed huts.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time spent in the city. Passengers on cruises are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos generally make a lot of effort to maximise the time and money spent by their customers. There are seldom windows and clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They generally offer special offers of food, drinks and entertainment to keep the guests happy and to keep them there.
On some sites, it is the locals who offer free alcoholic beverages. However, drunkenness impairs judgement, and all good players should know that it is crucial to remain sober.
Anyone travelling to high latitudes or crossing mountains must consider the possibility of snow, ice or cold temperatures.
On icy roads and icy conditions, friction is low and you can't drive like you're on the asphalt.
In the blizzards, it can fall very quickly enough snow to block you.
The visibility can also be limited by snow or sleet or by condensation or ice on the windows of vehicles.
In addition, the presence of ice and snow is normal in many countries, and the traffic is practically uninterrupted all year round.
Safaris are perhaps the most important tourist attraction in Africa and the most memorable moment for many visitors.
Safari" is a colloquial term for an African excursion, and in particular for an African safari, with the aim of witnessing the amazing spectacle of wild animals in their natural habitat.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach close to cars and the standard equipment allows them to be observed.
The lions, the leopards and the elephants are sometimes timid and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as 'walking safari', 'walking safari' or 'footing') consists of walking, either for a few hours, or for several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will take place in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympic Games, after hosting the Games in 1964.
If you have booked your flights and your accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you will be facing a difficult situation.
The policies of cancellation vary, but from mid-March, most cancellation policies based on the coronavirus do not extend to July 2020, the date on which the Olympic Games had been scheduled.
We expect that most events tickets will cost between EUR 2 500 and EUR 130 000, while typical event tickets will cost about EUR 7 000.
Wringing out wet clothes can make them dry more quickly. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards that can be borrowed, even if there aren't any in the rooms.
If you don't have a iron or don't want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if you find one.
Don't leave the fabric too hot (which can cause shrinkage or in extreme cases, burn it).
There are different methods of water purification, including some that are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, it is enough to boil water for a minute; in others, it is necessary to boil it for several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you have a problem, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers can encounter 'pests' they do not know in their home region.
Parasites can contaminate food, cause irritations or, in the most serious cases, cause allergies, spread venom or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals which can wound or kill people by force, are not usually considered as parasites.
In some areas, duty-free shops present an opportunity to buy exempt goods and excise duties.
Travellers to destinations where taxes are high can sometimes save a considerable amount, in particular on alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, passing frequently through isolated backcountry.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your eyes open: the steep gradients, narrow roads and tight curves predominate.
Speed limits are significantly lower than in previous sections – usually between 35 and 40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and their strict compliance is still more important than ever.
On the other hand, mobile service is surprisingly stronger here than on many other parts of the road, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cakes are rather good, and in Bavaria, they are very rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbour, Austria.

Indonesia having 17 000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines present in all of the country.
However, when this term is used without any other qualifying term, it tends to refer to foodstuffs originating from the central and eastern islands of Java.
Now, widely available throughout the archipelago, the Javanese cuisine offers a wide range of simple dishes, the predominant flavours being the nuts, chillies, sugar (mainly the coconut sugar of Java) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are used to support the feet of the rider, which hang from each side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability to the user, but they can pose a security problem: in fact, the user's feet can get stuck there.
If a rider is thrown from a horse, but has a leg caught in the stirrup, he could be dragged if the horse escapes. To minimise this risk, a number of security measures can be taken.
Firstly, most of the riders wear riding boots with a flat sole and a smooth leather upper.
In addition, some stools, in particular those of the English, have safety bars which allow a fork to fall from the saddle if it is pulled back by a rider who falls.
Valley of Cochamó – The excellence destination for rock climbing in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with many different granite faces and cliffs.
From the summits, the panoramas are unobstructed. The world's alpinists are discovering new routes on the slopes, where the possibilities are limitless. 
Skiing and snowboarding are popular sports which involve sliding down a snowy slope with skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity that has many enthusiasts, sometimes called'ski bums', who organise their entire holidays around skiing in specific places.
The idea of skiing is very old: there are some prehistoric paintings showing skiers dating for some of 5 000 years ago!
Skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 16th century; the first ski club in Australia was founded in 1861 by Norwegians.
Skiing: this activity is also called Nordic skiing, cross-country skiing or hiking skiing.
It resembles alpine skiing, but it is not really an alpine sport, and it does not include the use of skis and boots that are much stiffer than those used in alpine skiing.
Think of skiing as a similar hiking route.
In good conditions you can walk a little further than on foot – but you will rarely reach the speeds of skiing without a heavy pack on a muddy slope.
Europe is a continent of relatively small size, but containing many independent countries. In normal circumstances, travelling through several countries involves the need to apply for several visas and to undergo several passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, functions a little bit like one country in this respect.
As long as you remain in this area, you can usually cross borders without having to pass through passport control.
In addition, having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply separately for each of the member states of the Schengen area, which allows you to save time, money and administrative formalities.
There is no universal definition of an antique. Some tax authorities define objects over 100 years old as antiquities.
The criteria vary according to where one is located ; in some parts of the world, as in North America, the age limit can be lower than that in force in Europe. 
Artisanal products can be considered as antiquities even if they are less ancient than similar industrial products.
Reindeer herding is an important means of subsistence for Samis and the culture surrounding this trade is of great importance to many other professions.

The opinions presented are often superficial, general and too simplified in comparison to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
The violent time is the generic term for all dangerous meteorological phenomena that can cause damage, social disruption or human life loss.
The unfavourable weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and they can be of several kinds, according to the geographical, topographical and meteorological characteristics.
Tornadoes, thunderstorms, floods, excessive precipitation and fires are the effects of violent weather, just as tornadoes, hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons are.
Extreme weather phenomena, regional and seasonal, include cold weather, snowstorms with violent winds, and sandstorms or dust storms.
It is strongly recommended that travellers check the weather in their destination area, knowing that it may have an impact on their travel plans.
Anyone considering travelling to a country which could be considered a war zone should receive a professional training.
A search on the Internet for "Cours in hostile environment" will probably provide the address of a local company.
A course will cover the issues raised here in much more detail, generally with a practical experience.
A training usually lasts for two to five days and includes role playing, first aid, and sometimes gun handling training.
Books and magazines on survival in the wild are common, but publications on war zones are scarce.
Travellers planning to undergo a gender reassignment abroad should ensure that they have valid travel documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with the gender of the person indicated (X) or to update documents to reflect the person's name and sex wishes varies.
The foreign governments' willingness to honour these documents is as variable as the weather.
The security checkpoint searches have also become much more intrusive in the era of post-11 September 2001.
Transgender people in the pre-op phase should not expect to be scanned in privacy and dignity.
The shore breakers are the ones that come back from the waves that break on the beach, often on a reef or equivalent.
Because of the underwater topography, the return flow is concentrated on a few sections deeper, and a fast current can form in the deep waters.
In most cases, deaths are caused by exhaustion resulting from attempting to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, the return to swimming is not more difficult than usual.
You should try to aim at a place where you will not be taken again. It is also possible that, depending on your competences and whether you have been spotted or not, you may want to wait for help.
The reintegration shock occurs earlier than the cultural shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travellers who have had a hard time adapting to the new culture have sometimes had a lot of trouble adapting to their home culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and have lost some of your old culture's habits.
At first, when you went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travellers in a new country must adapt.
People may not be anticipating that patience and understanding are also necessary for passengers and passengers returning home.
The light and sound show at the Pyramid is one of the most interesting attractions in the region for children.
You can see the pyramids in the darkness and you can see them in silence before the show begins.

The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and the various pyramids are lit.
The Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the largest number of research stations and 16 of them are active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. The island of King George, with the village of Villa Las Estrellas, is the largest.
Other examples: Livingston Island and the Deception, where the still active caldera of a volcano offers a spectacular natural harbour.
Ellsworth Land is the eastern part of the Bellingshausen peninsula.
The mountains of the peninsula are melting into the plateau, then reappearing to form the Ellsworth Range, a 360 km long and traversed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern chain, or Sentinel, contains the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson massif, which stands at 4892 m.
In remote areas without cellular network, you may not have other choice than to use satellite telephony.
Satellite telephones do not replace mobile phones, because you need to be outside and have a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
It is a common service used by navigation, including boats and expeditions that require data transmission at a distance and telephony.
Your local telecommunications operator should be able to tell you more about the connection to this service.
People who plan a year off work have the option to learn while travelling, and more and more of them choose this option.
This formula is particularly popular with young people who leave school, as it allows them to take a year off before university, without compromising their studies.

Generally, fees apply for these educational programmes.
Finland is a popular destination for sailing. The "Land of the thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, in lakes and in coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht in the archipelagoes and lakes.
While the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for a boat, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Sailing is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden and New Zealand are in the same situation, but apart from that, it is a unique case (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one to forty).

If you do not go to the ground with cruise excursions, you will not need a separate visa (from 2009).
Berlin, in Germany, is mentioned in some brochures for cruises. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not at all located near the sea and no visit to this city is included in the cruise price. 
Travelling by air can be a terrifying experience for all ages and from all walks of life, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
Don't be ashamed: it is not different from personal fears and fears that many people have about other things.
For some, understanding something about the functioning of aircraft and what happens during a flight can help to overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or on the fact that you do not have control.
The companies that provide fast delivery are well paid for doing so. In many cases, in urgent repairs, the question of time is crucial for documents, goods or spare parts that relate to them.
On some roads, the big companies have their own planes, but on other roads and for small companies, there has been a problem.
If they had shipped goods by air, on some routes, it would have taken days to clear the loading and customs.
The only way to do it was to send it as registered baggage. The aviation regulations will not allow them to send a bag without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The easiest way to travel in first class or business class is to pay a large sum of money for this privilege (or, better still, ask your company to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: generally, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal tariff for business class, and eleven times for first class!
Generally, it is pointless to try to get discounts for business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that they can count on a certain type of passengers who are willing to pay very high prices for the privileges of speed and comfort, and they set their prices in good faith.

Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Don't make the site look like a graffiti site by painting or scratching on the structures.
Barcelona's official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, a majority understands it, and almost everyone is able to speak Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, because the law establishes that it is the first official language.

However, those who speak a little Spanish might conclude prematurely that the Portuguese is sufficiently close to Spanish to not need to be studied separately.
Premodern observatories are generally obsolete today, and remain as museums or educational sites.
As the light pollution of their time was not as serious as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, easier to access than those built in the modern era.
Modern research telescopes are enormous infrastructures placed in remote regions where the weather conditions are favourable.
Hanami, the Japanese tradition of viewing the cherry blossoms, is a part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept came from China, where the plum blossom was the favorite flower.
