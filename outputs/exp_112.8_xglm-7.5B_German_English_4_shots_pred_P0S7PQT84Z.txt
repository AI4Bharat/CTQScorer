This confirms not only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides details that fossils do not provide, such as colour and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the fur of this animal was brown on top and light- or carotenoid-coloured on the bottom.
The discovery also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well developed sheath called a quill, but other features of feathers — hooks and barbules — the researchers concluded that the quill must have been an evolutionary development later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or for the heartbeat.
The researchers claimed that the sample was the tail of a young dinosaur, but the test showed no feathers.

The road, on which the accident took place, was temporarily closed while the rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was indicted in the meantime before the Edinburgh Sheriff Court on charges of murdering her son.
She is in custody until the prosecution and trial, but eyewitness statements could be exaggerated because her image has been widely published.
This is a practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish judiciary works differently, and the courts have considered the publication of photographs as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes: "Journalists seem to be crossing a dangerous line when they publish photographs and other material of suspects.
The Crown Office has hinted that it will not be commenting further on the case until the prosecution has made its case.
According to a leak, the document refers to the border dispute in which the Palestinians demand a reversal of the borders in the state of 1967 prior to the Six-
Other issues, which are allegedly covered, include the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel wants a military presence in the Jordan Valley for ten years from the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority is willing to accept such a presence for five years.
The sniper teams accompanying the attempt to control the outbreak should be closely supervised by rangers, as the attempt has been monitored and evaluated.
In the context of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers have been recruited for the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Executive Director of Park Conservation and Heritage in the NPWS, the four selected for the first operation were given comprehensive security and training." #
Martelly has just appointed a new provisional electoral commission (CEP) with nine members.
It is his fifth CEP within four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of the package of measures to steer the country in the direction of new elections.
The Commission was the response of President Martelly to the widespread regime-critical protests that began in October.
The trigger for the sometimes violent protests was the failure to hold elections, some of which are due to be held in 2011.
Over 60 cases of overheating have been reported in iPods. In total, six fires have been set and four people have suffered minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that it had 27 accidents in connection with the devices.
Last week, the METI announced that it had received 34 reports of overheating from Apple, which it described as "not serious
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded by describing Apple's decision to postpone the report as "really regrettable.
The earthquake shook Mariana at 07:19 p.m. local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Office for Civil Protection of the Northern Marians said that there were no reports of damage in the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center had declared that there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has taken tourists from Hong Kong as hostages, by kidnapping their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot with his M16 rifle at the tourists.
At least six confirmed dead have been rescued.
Six hostages, including the children and the elderly, were released early, as well as the Filipino photographers." #
The photographers took the place of an elderly lady as she had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and became a doctor.
He became a midwife and took up his work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working in the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature contractions.
His research showed that the application of a hormone accelerated the lung development of the foetus.
Xinhua reported that investigators from the Chinese government have recovered two "black box" flight recorders.
Ringer colleagues also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of extremes. My first manager. Luna died in the night of the two moons. Very unique, exactly like she. A strong woman.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels gave the following comment: "Luna was as crazy as I was... maybe even crazier... I love her and I will miss her... hopefully she is in a better place.
Of the 1,400 people who were questioned in the run-up to the federal elections in 2010, the proportion of those who oppose Australia becoming a republic has risen by 8 percent.
The temporary leader of the Australian government, Julia Gillard, during the election campaign for the federal election of 2010, said that she believed Australia would end its monarchy at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 per cent of respondents share this view and want that Elizabeth II is the last Australian monarch.
29 per cent of those surveyed said that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 per cent of those polled said that Australia should never become a republic.
The gold medal winner at the Olympic Games should swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three-person relay events, but because of his many complaints, his fitness was doubted.
He was not able to take the necessary medication to overcome his pain, as they are banned at the Commonwealth Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Many people confirmed the discovery via different hardware and software in February and on Tuesday it was announced.
Cosmic dust may have been a source of water supply for the earth, together with organic matter that forms proteins and allows life.
Cosmic comets have collided with the Earth in the distant past, and scientists are hoping to gain insights into how planets, in particular the Earth, are formed.
Cuomo (53) took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He described the rumours as "political nonsense and idleness.
It is speculated that he may be nominated for the post of President in 2016.
NextGen is a system claimed by the FAA that it would allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of the older technology based on ground radar to enable the air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
There will be no additional transport facilities established and the underground trains will not stop at Wembley. There are no parking or parking-and-ride facilities available at the venue.
With concern about the lack of transport facilities, the likelihood grew that the game would be played behind closed doors.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the emergence of a new bird species on the Galápagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the US and the Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species had developed within just two generations, despite the previous assumption that this process took place due to the mating between a native Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris, which took much longer.
Gold can be rolled into a number of different forms.
It can be twisted into a thin wire that can be bent and braided.
It can be made so thin that it sometimes became a means of decorating handwritten pictures, called picture manuscripts, in books called picture manuscripts.
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator with red apple juice.
The carbon dioxide changes its colour, depending on whether it is acidic or basic (alkaline).
The pH level points to the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemicals.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electrons (because hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and
Mix the two powders together and then form them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a protective layer.
The cities Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had almost every house equipped with a flush toilet, which was connected to an elaborate
Remains of sewage systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia and China, there were toilets. In Roman culture, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses that men and women visited in mixed company.
If you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back down to earth almost immediately.
The satellite was launched by a rocket into space. Scientists use telescopes in space, because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and our view.
It is necessary to launch a gigantic rocket with a height of more than 100 feet to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest service it has given us is much easier and faster transport.
It has brought us the railway, the car and many other means of transport.
In addition to cats of medium size, which eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to elephants and rhinos,
Finally, there are still many small cats (including free-roaming domestic cats) that eat much smaller prey animals such as insects, rodents, amphibians
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a special task which every cat has and which ensures that they do not compete with other cats.
Lions are the most social cats. They live in large groups, which are called 'herds'.
The packs are composed of one to three adult males and up to thirty females and young males.
Women usually have a close relationship with each other when they live in a large family with sisters and daughters.
Lions act in a similar way to wolf packs or dogs, animals that surprise the lion (but not other large cats) in their behavior and are equally lethal to their prey
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (although not particularly well), swim, long distance jump and with the fivefold power of a strong man pull.
The tiger is in the same family (genus) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger does not sound like the confident roar of the lion, but rather like a series of grumbling grumbling words.
Ocelot hunters eat small animals. If they can, they will steal monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than he is.
Scientists think that otters track prey (food) with their olfactory senses and find it by sniffing it.
They can see in the dark very well and move undetected. Ocelots hunt their prey by matching their environment visually and then attacking it.
If a small group of animals (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it comes (for example, if they move over a mountain or a river or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they did previously.
This new environment has other resources and other competitors, so that the new population needs different characteristics or adaptations in order to be a strong competitor than what it used to need.
The original population has not changed at all. It still needs the same adaptations as before.
As time goes by, the new population adapts to their new environment, and then they look less and less like the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, two populations will look so different that they will no longer be classified as the same species.
This process is called specialization, which simply means the emergence of new species. It is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that we breathe, and they take carbon dioxide that we exhale (which is to say, exhale).
Plants produce their food by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses out of plants and make clothes out of plants. We eat mainly plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the largest predator of its time, so he feared nothing but other Mosasaurs.
His long jaws were equipped with more than 70 sharp teeth, including a second set on the tongue, which meant that there was no escape for any animal that crossed his path.
We don't know for sure, but he must have had a hooked tongue. He ate fish, large fish, other Mosasaurs and maybe even a cannibal.
He also took everything that came in to the water; even a great dinosaur like the T. Rex was not going to be able to withstand his wrath.
While most of their food would be known to them, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual meals, including wild boar, peacock, snails and a kind of frog called the seven-legged frog.
Another difference was that the poor people ate their food on chairs. The rich men preferred to hold banquets where they sat on the side, while they ate their meals.
Roman courts could not contain food that came from America or Asia in later centuries.
They had no wheat, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no Romans ever ate a turkey.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a temple, which was regarded as the house of the god.
Man offered sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to comply with the will of the gods.
Every temple had an open temple and then an inner altar room which was only accessible by priests.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The tip of the tower was a special shrine for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses did not have such a great importance.
The majority of the time spent by the Hebrew family was spent outdoors.
The women cooked in the yard. Shops were simply open to the street. For the construction of the house, stone was used.
In Canaan there were no large forests, so that wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the old Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder. When he travelled further west, he found Greenland and gave it the name Greenland.
But regardless of its discovery, the Eskimo people lived there already at that time.
Although all the countries were Scandinavian, there were many differences between the people, the Kings, the customs and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the film The Templer's Legacy, you may think that on the reverse of the Declaration of Independence there was a map of treasure.
That is not true. Although on the reverse of the document there is written something, it is not a treasure map.
The declaration is written on the reverse side, with the words 'original declaration of independence, dated on 4 July 1776'.
Whether or not it was written by someone, it is known that the great scroll (which measures 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up at the beginning of its life to be stored.
It is therefore possible that the labelling was added simply as a label.
The landing on D-Day and the subsequent battles freed the north of France, but the south was still not free.
He was ruled by the "Vichy"" French. These were French who had signed a peace treaty with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the occupiers, rather than fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies landed in southern France; the invasion was called 'Operation Dragoon'.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the French liberated the south of France and turned their attention towards Germany.
A civilisation is a distinct culture shared by a significant number of people who live together and work, a society.
The word civilisation comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin word civis, which means citizen and civitas, which means city or city state.
Cities are the forerunners of nations. A civilised culture implies the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint and a proper dissemination.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving any significant historical evidence behind and fail to be recognised as genuine civilisations.
While the revolutions were in progress, the 13 states formed on the basis of the Federal Treaty first formed a weak central government, consisting of the Congress.
The Congress was not empowered to tax, and there was no national executive or national judiciary, so it relied on the authorities of the states, which often did not cooperate.
He had no authority to suspend tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous consent of all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so little seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world and was 2006 FIFA World Champions.
Favourite sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula One motor racing.
 Winter sports are popular in the northern regions and Italians take part in international competitions and Olympic Games.
Japan has nearly 7000 islands (of which Honshu is the largest), making it the seventh largest island in the world.
Because of the archipelago, Japan is often referred to as an archipelago.
The beginning of Taiwan goes back to the 15th century, when European sailors passed by and named the island as Ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
1624 the Dutch East India Company establishes a trading post in the South-West of Taiwan, which initiates a change in the cultivation methods of the indigenous peoples and employs Chinese workers on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, when the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan, it declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
1895 the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists mainly of three buildings, namely the Intihuatana, the sun temple and the space of the three windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex were rebuilt to give visitors a better idea of how they looked originally.
By 1976, thirty per cent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration work continues to this day.
For example, 35 mm is the most widely used film format in the world at the end of the analog film era.
It is still made, but it is more important that its format has been taken over by digital camera sensor formats.
In fact, the 35-mm format is confusingly 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The ratio of this format (divided by twelve, to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore referred to as 3:2.
Many of the usual formats (the APS format family, for example) have exactly the same or very similar aspect ratio.
The oft-maligned and often mocked third rule is a simple directive that creates dynamism and at the same time preserves order in a picture.
It states that the intersection of the lines that divide a picture vertically and horizontally is the most effective place for the main motif (see example)." #
In this period of European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church was under scrutiny.
Since more than a thousand years, Christianity has kept the European states united despite different languages and customs.
His omnipotence ruled over everyone, from the king to the humblest citizen.
One of the most important Christian beliefs states that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty.
The central authority of the church was in Rome for more than a thousand years. This concentration of power and money caused many to doubt whether this principle was adhered to.
In the immediate aftermath of fighting breaking out in Germany, Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective, as it cut off the country from vital military and civilian supplies, despite this blockade contravening the generally recognised principles of international law that have been codified in several international treaties of the last two centuries.
Britain contaminated international waters in order to prevent ships from penetrating whole oceanic areas, which was a danger for neutral ships as well.
The response to this tactic was limited, and Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s pacifism and isolation were the dominant attitudes of most citizens and countries.
After the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the nations of Europe wanted to avoid another such situation in the future.
1884, Nikola Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, with a book of poetry and a recommendation letter from Charles Batchelor (his superior at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
The old China had a unique way of showing different eras. Each era in China and each family in power was a separate dynasty.
The dynastic periods also had periods of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the period of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and the Jin Dynasties.
In these times, there were bitter wars fought by many nobles vying for the throne.
The time of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died in the struggle for the highest throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metrical system, a departure from absolutism towards republicanism and nationalism as well as the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a ruler alone.
Also, after the revolution, all professions were open to all male applicants, so that the most ambitious and best could succeed.
The same applies to the military, because the ranks were based on the caliber rather than on the class.
The French Revolution inspired many oppressed people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed was very interested in things that went beyond the everyday life. He often visited a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Nur" (Light) to meditate.
The cave itself has survived the times and offers a lively picture of Mohammed's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find, even if you know that it exists. Once you are in the cave, you are completely isolated.
There is nothing but the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains from the inside of the cave. From the inside of the cave, very little of this world can be seen or heard.
The Cheops Pyramid is the only of the seven wonders of the world that still stands today.
The Cheops Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C. It is one of many great pyramids structures built to honor the dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau or the 'Gizeh Necropolis' in Egypt comprises several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honour of the Pharaoh Cheops and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honour of his wives and family members.
The "spread" symbol looks like a V and the "stretch" symbol looks like a square, with the lower line missing.
Up means that you start at the top and should move the arrow.
The erasing produces a softer sound, while the erasing produces a louder and more expressive sound.
You are free to add your own pencil marks; however, the printed lines are there for musical reasons, so they should be respected.
The terrified King Louis XIV, Queen Marie-Antoinette, her two small children (Marie-Therese, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old), as well as the sister of the King, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris by a mob of market women on 6 October 1789.
They travelled in a carriage back to Paris, surrounded by a mob of people who threatened the King and the Queen with threats.
The mob forced the King and Queen to open their windows wide.
Sometime later, a member of the angry mob turned his head in the direction of a royal guard killed in Versailles.
The US imperialists' war expenditures in the Philippines were borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover the bulk of expenditure, and the interest on the bonds flowed through the banks of Wall Street in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the superprofits that originated from the continual exploitation of the Filipino people were the basic profits of the US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you have to understand the context in which they were founded.
The era in which the events took place is generally referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history that spanned the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000–1300 A.D.).
The Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended in approximately 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technology push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that the human fate is determined by a fundamental logic that is linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas. On the one hand, that the development of technology is a process that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and on the other, that technology itself has "effects" on societies that are more intrinsic than socially determined.
It is possible to say that the motor vehicle is a necessary development of roads.
However, a national road network for only a small number of cars is economically not sustainable. Therefore, new production methods are developed to reduce the costs of car ownership.
The widespread ownership of cars also leads to an increased number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques in the health sector for repairing damaged bodies.
The Romanticism had a strong, cultural deterministic element which was drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography was the key to individuals' formation. Over time, customs and cultures developed with reference to this geography and these, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
So as to be known as the capital of fashion in the modern world, Paris was the capital of the Feudal Europe.
His fame as the epicenter of luxury began about 400 B.C. and lasted until about 1100 A. D.
His status declined in the 12th century, which was mainly due to the Crusaders returning with gifts such as silk and spices which were considered more valuable than the offerings of the Byzantine markets.
At this time, the title of the world's fashion capital was also transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries.
At the beginning, the clothing was strongly influenced by the culture of Byzantium in the East.
However, the styles in the West are 25 to 30 years behind the rest of the world.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop a distinctive style. One of the most important developments of the time was the fact that people began to use buttons to fasten their clothing.
Agricultural economy is agriculture that aims to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer or the farmer's family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often biological farming method that uses surplus, locally-grown seed and combines it with rotational farming or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
In the past, most farmers were subsistence farmers and in many developing countries, that is still the case.
Subcultures bring together people who feel neglected by social norms and enable them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be differentiated on the basis of age, ethnicity, class, place and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as such can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual or geographical in nature or a combination of these factors.
The members of a subculture often signal their membership by a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits and jargon.
One of the most common methods of illustrating the importance of socialization is to rely on the few unfortunate cases of children who have not been socialized by adults because of neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse during their childhood.
Those children are called "wild" or "wild." Some wild children were kept by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, neglect was due to the inability of the parents to accept the severe intellectual or physical limitations of the child.
Wolf cubs may have suffered severe child abuse or suffered traumatic experiences before they were abandoned or escaped.
Others have been reared by animals; some have lived alone in the wild.
If it has been raised entirely by animals, the wild child displays behaviours (in the context of his or her physical capabilities) that almost entirely match those of his or her specific carer, such as his or her fear or indifference to people.
Project-based learning should make learning more interesting and easier, but scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a tool that supports individuals in a new learning situation such as when they are using a new computer program or when they are starting a new project.
Armoured vehicles can be virtual or real. In other words, a teacher is a form of a bricklayer, but also the little office stapler in Microsoft Office.
Virtual assistance is built into the software and it is intended to question, suggest and explain the steps that the student may not be able to cope with on his own.
Children are placed in foster homes for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse, exploitation and extortion.
No child should have to grow up in a environment that is not caring, loving and educational, but many are forced to do so.
For us, the care system is a piece of security for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving caregivers, a stable education and a reliable health care.
The foster home will cover all the needs that they would not have had in the home from which they were previously removed.
The Internet connects elements of mass communication, as well as interpersonal communication.
The specific features of the Internet have led to additional dimensions regarding the utility- and reward-based approach.
For example, learning and socialisation are cited as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal engagement and sustained relationships were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined the audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings led to important findings for the interpretation of microexpressions, short-lived facial movements.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect deception by correctly decoding the facial expressions of a minimal number of changes.
In his article, The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks showed how people with a brain injury can still accurately assess the honesty of people.
He even claims that the ability to interpret human behaviour may be shared with animals such as dogs.
Scientific research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation results in new genetic variations and selection removes these from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with each generation in and out.
Out in the savannah, it is very difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of a human being to meet his nutritional needs from available plant-based sources.
In addition, it has serious consequences if one fails to: depression, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for us, unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal food sources (insects, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide large quantities of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
Overall, it should not be a surprise if our own ancestors had their "protein problem" solved in the same way that chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep compensation is the process of targeted waking during normal sleep periods and the subsequent short sleep (10-60 minutes) later.
This can be achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up, without completely waking you up.
If you are someone who imagines the alarm clock in the night, you can place it on the other side of the room so that you have to leave the bed to turn it off.
Another way of looking at it is that you should drink a lot of fluids before going to bed (especially water or tea, which is known for its urinary-tonic effect), so that you have to get up to urinate.
The degree of inner calm that a person has is inversely proportional to the degree of tension in the body and mind.
The lower the tension is, the more positive is the potential for the existence of absolute calm and contentment. Everyone has the potential to find absolute calm and contentment.
Everyone can attain enlightenment. The only obstacle to this goal is our own tension and negativity.
The Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has been expanded to include the path of love of the Mahayana and numerous techniques of the Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (awakening energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The centre of the Tibetan meditation is the god-yoga. By visualising various gods, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are opened and the enlightened consciousness is born.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, which led to a cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war, the collision of systems, the course and culture of the countries led to a conflict.
Two years after the end of the war, the former Allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
He should last for the next 40 years and in reality be carried out by proxy armies on battlefields in Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defence was already completely broken down and the only hope lay in a retreat and a reorganisation along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans were quickly obsolete when over 800,000 Soviet soldiers invaded the white Russian and Ukrainian fronts and created, after they invaded in violation of the Riga Pact, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements into the eastern regions of Poland.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is the most efficient way to transport large human and goods volumes over the seas.
The task of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that a country is able to carry out its own people and goods, while at the same time preventing the enemy from carrying out its own people and goods.
One of the most significant recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign during the Second World War. The Americans attempted to bring personnel and material across the Atlantic to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic mainly by submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Britain exactly as the rest of Europe.
It is thought that goats were domesticated in the Zagros Mountains in Iran some 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and peoples began to keep them as livestock to get easily at their milk, fur, skin and meat.
Sheep were usually kept in herds, which wandered on hills or other pasture areas. They were looked after by shepherds, just like the more familiar sheepherders; often, it was children or adolescents. This grazing system is still used
In the 16th century, engineers in England built railways.
Although the railway tracks consisted of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses to travel faster and carry heavier loads than on the rougher roads of the time.
Since early on, barriers have been introduced to ensure that the railway is not overwhelmed. Gradually, however, it became apparent that railways carrying a railway track are more efficient.
This was the customary practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron railway tracks were introduced.
The first known mode of locomotion was walking. Man began walking about two million years ago with the appearance of the Homo erectus (which means "standing man").
Her predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk so regularly.
Two-footed species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3,9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can live more sustainably, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate future suffering a little.
It is in many cases merely a symptomatic treatment. If you are not only temporary solutions, then we should find the root of the problem and treat it.
It is really obvious that the world has changed due to the scientific and technological advances of mankind and that the problems caused by overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles of people have become more serious.
After its adoption by the Congress on 4 July, a handwritten draft, signed by the Congress President John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to the printer of John Dunlap some blocks away.
In the course of the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as "Dunlap broadsides.
The first public reading of the document took place on 8 July in the Independence Hall in Philadelphia.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
There are still 25 Dunlap broadsheets that are the oldest still existing copies of the document. The original handwriting has not survived the times.
Many paleontologists now believe that there is a group of dinosaurs that have survived and still live today. We call them birds.
Many see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But many things about birds still look like dinosaurs.
You have feet with claws and scales, lay eggs and run on both hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
Almost all of the computers used today are based on the processing of information in binary form.
A binary number can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or as bits, to use computer jargon.
A poisoning can be detected only after a period of time. The symptoms, for example vomiting, are so general that it is not possible to make a diagnosis immediately.
The best evidence of a poisoning by ingestion is the presence of an open container of medicines or toxic household chemicals.
Look at the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison.
The term 'wade' is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this insect group.
This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs. These insects are very adaptable in that they can parasitize people.
As well as bedbugs, also fleas are nidicolous, that is, adapted to live in their nests or in their hosts' homes.
In the United States of America there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which is the most common neurological disease in adults aged younger and middle-aged.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and the peripheral nervous system.
Studies have shown that the risk of developing MS is twice as high in women as in men.
A couple can decide that it is not in their own interest or in the best interests of their child to have a baby.
These couples can decide for a plan for their baby's adoption.
A child adopted by two parents gives up its parental rights, so that another couple can take on parental responsibilities.
The main aim of science is to discover how the world works. This method is in fact the basis of most scientific studies.
It is not only about experimentation, where an experiment is a test that is designed to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also guided by the setting of questions and the conduct of observations.
Natural scientists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts and in particular on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were widely accepted.
With the loss of Greek language skills, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behaviour are often based on the presence of body-specific cycles and their production by biological clocks.
A cycle-determined behaviour that is not only reactions to external cycles, but also to signals from within the cycle, is known in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that even in the absence of external signals continue to oscillate freely.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the most important evidences that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacteria.
They took two experiments, one in which they either tagged the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphor or a protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the genetic material concerned and whether it is a germline cell.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cancer or death.
Nature tourism draws people to visit areas of natural beauty, including wild plants and animals.
Exemplary activities are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
An example of this is the visit, the taking of photographs and the studying of orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small provincial towns with their cars, to their workplace and are passed by others whose workplace is the place they just left.
In this dynamic pendulum movement, all are in some way connected to a transport system based on private cars and support it.
Now, science has pointed out that this massive carbon economy has brought the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has been the human evolution in the last two million years.
Everyone takes part in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, you will rarely hear complaints about water quality or bridge collapses.
Why do transport systems fail so often? Why are transport engineers incompetent? Or is there something fundamentally wrong here?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them.
It is difficult to study traffic flows because you cannot predict driver behaviour with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave reasonably consistently; therefore, traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be represented mathematically in a rough way.
To better illustrate the flow of traffic, the relationships between the three main characteristics were defined: (1) river, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relations help in the planning, design and operation of facilities on the road.
The first animals to conquer the sky were insects. Their ability to fly helped them to evade enemies more easily and to find more efficient food and mates.
Most insects can fold their wings along their bodies.
They have a wider choice of small boots in which they can hide themselves from predators.
Today, butterflies and moths are the only insects that can not fold their wings.
In the distant past, a man named Aristarch claimed that the sun was at the centre of the movements of the solar system.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite: that the solar system including the sun (and even the other stars) revolved around the earth.
It seems reasonable, because it doesn't seem to happen to you that the earth moves.
The Amazon is the second longest and the water-richest river in the world. It flows more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, with some stretches of up to six miles wide.
20 percent of the water that flows through rivers on the planet goes to the oceans from the Amazon.
The Amazon basin mainstem is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It takes water from thousands of smaller rivers into it.
Although the building of pyramids continued up to the end of the Old Kingdom, the Pyramids of Gizeh were never surpassed in their size and the technical perfection of their construction.
Egyptians in the ancient New Kingdom gazed at the monuments of their forefathers, which were then more than a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of around 800 people. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language of most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known to mankind for thousands of years, since these can be found in their original form in nature and are easily extracted and reused with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, posited the theory that all things are made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements. This mixture was earth, water, air and fire.
This was more in line with the four states of aggregation (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma. He also posited the theory that they would transform into new substances, to form what we see.
Metals are in essence a mixture of two or more elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered as metals. Of course, there are also other metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
The universe is made up of matter in its entirety. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that billions of them would fit in the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was invented by many people to be a good friend.
It is sad that the pencil has been pushed aside by the introduction of new writing methods, so that it has been pushed back in its status and in its use.
People write news on computer screens, without ever having to get close to a rocket launcher.
I am sure that something new will come out of the keyboard when something new comes along.
The atom bomb is based on the principle that energy is required to combine a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like if you roll a heavy car up a hill. If the core is split, some of this energy will be released.
Some atoms have unstable cores, which means that they will break down even at the slightest provocation.
The surface of the Moon consists of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is known as the crust.
The outer layer is about 70 km thick on the near side and about 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the sea and thicker under the highlands.
On the near side, there could be more Maria, since the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
The content theories focus on what people are attracted to or move towards.
This theory suggests that people have certain needs and/or desires that are inculcated during their adulthood.
The theories concern what certain people do to want exactly the things they do, and what influences in their environment cause them to want to do or not to do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two behaviours can be discerned when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to'stay one of the boys' (or of the girls) or to'stay one of the girls'.
This sort of manager has problems, to take unpopular decisions, to carry out disciplinary measures, to assign responsibility, and to make employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, you become an unrecognizable individual who has to do everything differently than the team has done and takes everything for itself.
Finally, the manager is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behaviour often leads to friction between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are managed in the same way as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members have a function for their immediate physical group that is often a contact point.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, since their teams can meet in different time zones that may not be taken into account by the local leadership.
A true invisible team (Larson and LaFasto 1989) is also an unique component of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the leadership team that reports to each member. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organisation take the time and effort to introduce an organisational learning concept? A goal for the practical implementation of organisational learning concepts is innovation.
If all available resources are effectively used by all departments of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can arise.
In the end, the joint work of a Community organisation can lead to a new innovative process, to respond to customer needs.
Before an organisation can be innovative, the leadership must develop a culture of innovation and shared knowledge and learning.
Angel (2006) explains the concept of the continuum as a method to help organisations become more efficient.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognitive processes. This limits the research field and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that various types of brain damage such as trauma, injuries and tumours can influence the behaviour and cause changes in some brain functions.
New emerging technologies allow us to see and explore certain brain structures and processes for the first time.
This provides us with many information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our heads.
KI is not only associated with science fiction, but is an important branch of computer science which deals with behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in the field of KI includes the production of machines for automating tasks that require intelligent behaviour.
For example, control, the setting of strategies and timetables, the ability to answer customer questions and queries, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Things like these have become independent disciplines, which concentrate on finding solutions to problems of the real world.
The artificial intelligence system is used today in many areas of economy, medicine, engineering and military, and is also incorporated in numerous software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of every school. Often a teacher would like to take her students to places where a bus journey is not possible.
Virtual excursions are a technical solution. Pupils can view museum objects from their classrooms, visit aquariums or admire beautiful art works from their classrooms.
Sharing a virtual trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and to share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design each year a website about their trip to the capital of the state. The website is updated each year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a collection album.
Blogs can also help improve the writing skills of students. Although students at the beginning of their blog experience often have a sloppy grammar and spelling, this usually changes as a result of a readership.
Students are often very critical audiences, so the blogger tries to improve his writing style to avoid criticism.
The blogging forces the students to learn more about the world around them. The need to attract the audience's interest inspires the students to write smart and interesting.
Blogging is a tool which inspires collaboration and encourages pupils to continue learning outside the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can enable pupils to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet material, pupils can define their own positions in the context of texts of others and present their own perspectives on particular topics.
Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital of Canada and is home to a number of art galleries and museums that present Canada's past and present.
In the south are the Niagara Falls, and in the north the untouched beauty of nature spreads out to Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and other things make Ontario unique as what is considered typical of Canada by outsiders.
The large areas further north are sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that many surprises: There are more African Americans in the USA than Canadian citizens.
The islands in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Africa are located.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, as far as the animal world is concerned, a separate continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or attached to France and are known as luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to the land, and in the Comoros and in Mayotte it was very successful.
The European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese sailor Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
The region in the north is bounded by the Sahel zone and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travellers must declare their marital status, irrespective of their actual marital status.
Also wearing a ring is helpful (don't wear a ring that looks too expensive).
Women should recognise that cultural differences can lead to what they regard as an assault, and that it is not uncommon to be followed, handcuffed, etc.
Keep your integrity, if you reject men and don't hesitate to defend your position (cultural differences aside; that does not mean that it is okay!)
Today's Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Merinides as a strategic port with the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed them and rebuilt them under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon them after a major earthquake in 1755.
The Ottoman Sultan built the city as Dar el Beida again and it was called Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
It is not easy to find traditional Moroccan goods in the old Medina, but that is all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the extreme east near Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city, especially the city centre, underneath itself.
While Goma is relatively safe, it is important to plan your stay outside Goma carefully to learn about the ongoing fighting in North Kivu.
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of the Nyiragongo volcano and for some of the cheapest gorilla tracking tours in Africa.
You can use Bodabodas (motorbike taxis) to get around Goma. The usual (local) price is about 500 Congolese Francs for a short ride
This in combination with its relative remoteness has made "Timbuktu" a metaphor for exotic, faraway countries.
Although Timbuktu is known as a tourist destination and has a airport, it is today a poor city.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger because of the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the most important stops on Louis Gates' PBS special "Africa's Wonders.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the cities of the country, because it is more Arab than African in character.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa. It borders in the east with Mozambique, in the north with Zimbabwe and in
The park has an area of 19 500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecosystems, each supporting a different animal world.
He is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is regarded as the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As all South African national parks, the Kruger National Park charges daily entry fees.
It may also be worth buying a wild card, which grants access either to selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the namesake of the territory of Hong Kong and is the focus of many tourists.
The buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline were compared with a shimmering bar chart that is visible through the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour. x
For the best hope of Hong Kong, you should leave the island and drive to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
The bulk of the city formation of Hong Kong Island is concentrated along the newly acquired land along the north coast.
This is the place where the British colonists have taken it over. If you look for traces of the colonial past of the area, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forest belt in the world and extend over 80 km from the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland to the coast.
The Sundarbans were declared a World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is known as Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not only mangrove swamps - they encompass some of the last remaining remnants of the mighty forest that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans extend over an area of 3,850 km2, of which one third is covered by water and marshes.
The Sundarbans are a nature reserve since 1966 and estimates suggest that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer there.
Buses run all day long from the district-wide bus station (on the other side of the river) and most of the buses, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30 a
Buses between the districts are often full, so it is advisable to buy a ticket in advance.
The majority of districts are by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
Taxi collections offer a fast and comfortable way to get to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a curved cable bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana." #
Your two towers are 83 metres high, their length is 378 metres and they have two lanes with 3,50 m width.
The bridge's height is 15 metres. The construction work was completed in August 2011, but the opening for traffic took place only in March 2017.
The bridge will be fully operational in September 2017. It is expected that the Brazilian customs checkpoints will then be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group that inhabited the present-day eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters, who
The Chaco region was also the home of other indigenous groups, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, collecting
Paraguay, formerly the province of West Indies, was named after the Spanish conquistadors who came together with the native indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began colonization, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for its polo team and its players to be among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place at Las Cañitas Polo fields in December.
Small tournaments and competitions can also be watched at other times of the year.
Informations on competitions and venues for polo tickets can be found at the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is set in accordance with the value of the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged in the only bank on the island, which is opposite the FIC West Store.
The British pound will generally be accepted everywhere on the islands and at Stanley credit cards. Also US dollars are often accepted.
On the remote islands credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, but British and American currencies can be accepted; ask the owners in advance which payment method is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland Islands' currency outside the islands themselves, so you should exchange your money before you leave the island.
As Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is there summer when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the tropics. In the summer months, temperatures can reach +30 °C.
The winter can be misleadingly cold: the temperatures rarely fall below freezing point, but wind and humidity lead to a feeling of colder than what the thermometer shows.
There are no distinct wet or dry seasons: The amount of rainfall remains the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to the sight of humans, the wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the instructions of the park authorities, visitors should keep at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals.
Even if Bisons, Wapitis, Elches, Bears and virtually all large animals can act peacefully, it can still happen that they turn on each other.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured, because they do not take enough space. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so leave them enough space.
Also be aware that odours attract bears and other wild animals. Avoid carrying strong-smelling food or cooking it and keep a clean stock.
Apia is the capital of the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 18th century and is the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a shameful stalemate in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships except one British warship were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans died.
While the Mau movement was organising a peaceful demonstration in the city, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the killing of the chief of the Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
In addition to Auckland having two harbours, there are many beaches. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) lie on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Everyone is a sandy beach with safe swimming and most offer shade from the Pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located at the port of Waitemata, in the upper suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
There are family beaches, which are sometimes overcrowded, with a beautiful promenade along the coast. Swimming is here safe.
The most important local beer is "Number One". It is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is "Manta".
There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines are probably better tolerated.
Local tap water can be safely drunk, but if you are concerned about it, you will also find bottled water.
For Australians, the idea of coffee ""flat white"" is alien. A small black is ""espresso"" and a cappuccino is filled with foam (not with milk) and tea is served without milk
The hot chocolate is Belgian standard. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many diving trips take place all year round and any kind of injury caused by any of these causes on the reef is rare.
However, you should follow the advice of authorities and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
Shrimps are common in the vicinity of beaches and in the vicinity of river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can also occasionally occur outside this period
Haies exist, but they are rarely aggressive towards people. Most of them are afraid of people and would flee.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live in active waters, their primary habitat is in river mouths north of Rockhampton.
A reservation in advance gives the traveller the certainty that he will be able to find accommodation when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although you may also book other accommodations, such as tents, through a travel agency.
Travel agents usually offer packages in which breakfast, transport to and from the airport or even a combination of flight and hotel are included.
You can also hold your reservation for you if you need time to reconsider the offer or to obtain further documents for your destination (e. g. a visa).
Any changes or requests should however be made first to the travel agency and not directly to the hotel.
Many festivals are decided by a large majority of festival-goers to camp out, and most visitors believe that this is an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you will need to get there early to get a campsite close to the music.
Remember that on parts of the festival, music will continue to be played until late into the night even though the music on the main stages has stopped.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the state of the cabin, for breaking through ice can be quite deafening for those most affected.
Cruises to St. Petersburg also offer time to visit the city. Passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos generally try very hard to keep guests for as long as possible and to spend as much money as possible. There are usually no windows or watches, and exits can sometimes be difficult to find.
You usually have a special offer for food, drinks and entertainment to keep the guests entertained and to ensure that they stay.
Some casinos offer alcoholic beverages for free. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good players know how important it is to remain sober.
Anyone who wants to drive in high latitudes or over mountain passes should be prepared for snow, ice and temperatures below freezing.
On icy and snowy roads the liability is low and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
In very short time, so much snow can fall that you can get stuck.
The visibility can also be affected by falling or drifting snow or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, cold and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic is running all year round largely uninterrupted.
Safaris are probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
Safari is a term of art used in everyday language to describe a trip to Africa to see the overwhelming wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars close, and the standard equipment makes it easy to see.
Lion, leopard and cheetah are often timid and you can observe them better with a telescope.
A bushwalk is a walk that lasts for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will take place at other venues in all Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Olympic Games, after having already hosted the Games in 1964.
If you have booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the rescheduling was announced, you could end up in a difficult situation.
The cancellation rules vary, but from the end of March most cancellation rules did not apply until July 2020, for the Olympic Games were to be held in July.
It is estimated that most tickets will cost between 2,500¥ and 130,000¥, a typical ticket will cost approximately 7,000¥.
Dry clothes can be ironed to help dry them. Many hotels also have irons and ironing boards, even if you are not present in the room.
If there is no iron available or you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can try to use a hairdryer if one is available.
Be careful that the substance does not get too hot (it can shrink it or cause burns in extreme cases).
There are various methods for cleaning water. Some of them are more effective than others in preventing certain dangers.
In some regions, it is enough to boil water for a minute, in others it must be several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies greatly, and if you have any concerns, then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers can encounter animal pests that they do not know from their home regions.
Vermin can destroy food, cause irritation or even cause allergic reactions, give poison or transmit diseases.
Infectious diseases as such or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people are usually not classified as vermin.
Free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from duties and taxes at certain locations.
Travellers, whose destination country has a high taxation, can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, particularly in the case of products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmount on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway is the most challenging driving section, as it often leads through remote, undeveloped terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: steep gradients, narrow roads and sharp turns prevail here.
The speed limits given are noticeably lower than in the previous and following sections - usually between 35 and 40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict compliance with them is even more important than usual." #
However, interestingly, the mobile coverage here is much better than in many other areas of the route, for example, the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German bread is very tasty. In Bavaria, it is very rich and varied, just as in the southern neighbour Austria.
Bread made from apples is widely used all year round, and pears and plums are used in summer.
Many German cakes also contain almonds, hazelnuts or other nuts. Popular cakes often fit particularly well to a cup of strong coffee.
If you want to produce small, but rich baked goods, then try the ones that are referred to as Berliner, pancakes or crêpes.
A curry is a dish that is based on herbs and spices, with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either dry or wet depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is usually used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is used
With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a catch-all term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines that can be found throughout the country
The term is used without further attributes to denote the food that originated from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine, which is now widely spread throughout the archipelago, offers a variety of simple spiced dishes. As flavouring agents, the Javans prefer nuts, chilis, sugar (especially javan coconut sugar) and a number of aromatic spices.
bridles are aids for the feet of the riders who are suspended from the saddle on both sides.
They give the horse more stability, but there are security concerns because the feet of the horse may get caught in them.
If a horse falls off and gets caught on the stirrup, he can be pulled along if the horse passes. To minimise this risk, a number of precautions can be taken.
Firstly, most riders wear boots with a heel and a smooth, narrow sole.
In addition, some saddles, in particular English saddles, have safety buckles which allow a saddle to fall off when it is pulled back by a falling rider.
The Cochamó Valley - Chile's most important climbing destination, known as the Yosemite National Park of South America, with a large number of large granite walls and -cliffs.
The summits offer a spectacular view. Climbers from all over the world discover new routes along the walls, which offer endless possibilities.
Departure sports such as skiing and snowboarding are popular sports in which one attaches skis or a snowboard to his feet and descends over a snow covered slope.
Skiing is a popular holiday activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as'ski-bunnies', who plan their entire holiday around skiing at a particular place.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depicting skiers go back to 5000 B.C.
The origins of skiing as a sport go back at least to the 17th century and in 1861 the first ski club in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Backpacking with a backpack: This activity is also known as ski touring or ski walking.
It resembles alpine skiing or mountaineering, but it does not necessarily include it, as these are undertaken in steep terrain and require much stiffer skis and boots.
Look at the ski route as a comparable hiking route.
If you are in good health, you can walk further distances than you would on a hiking trip – only very rarely will you reach the speed of skiing on well-groomed ski trails without a heavy pack." #
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries. Normally you would have to apply for multiple visas and go through multiple passport controls if you want to travel through several countries.
The Schengen area works in this respect somewhat like a country.
So long as you remain within this zone, you can usually cross the border without having to go through the passport control again.
According to this, you will not have to apply for a Schengen visa for each of the Schengen Member States individually, which saves time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universally accepted definition of what is considered an antique. Some tax authorities define over 100 years old goods as antiquities.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be lower in areas such as North America than in Europe.
Handcrafted products could be described as 'antique', even though they are younger than similar products produced in mass production.
The reindeer herding industry is a major source of livelihood for the Sámi people, and the culture around trade is also important for many who work in other professions.
Also, in the past, not all Sámi have bred reindeer in large numbers, but have lived from fishing, hunting and so on. Reindeer were their main livestock.
Today, many Sámi work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
In addition, the term ""Gypsies"" is often used by non-Roma as a derogatory term, since it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma.
If for a country you are visiting, a travel warning is issued, your travel insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may consult the advice of other governments as your own. Their advice is however aimed at their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may be confronted with other situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Conferences are merely a summary of the political situation in a country.
The views expressed are often superficial, general and oversimplified in comparison to the more detailed information that can be found elsewhere.
Weather hazards are the collective term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, social disruption or loss of human life.
Floods can occur anywhere in the world and there are different types of them, depending on the geography, topography and the atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall and forest fires are forms and effects of weather phenomena, as well as thunderstorms, tornado
Regional and seasonal weather phenomena are, inter alia, blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be on the lookout for any type of weather that affects their area, as this will affect all travel plans.
Everyone planning to travel to a country which is designated as a war zone should have a professional training for that.
A search on the Internet for ""course on hostile environments"" will probably bring up the address of a local company.
A course covers all the problems discussed in this discussion in a much more detailed way, usually combined with practical experience.
A course typically lasts for two to five days and includes role-playing, much first aid and sometimes weapons training.
There are numerous books and journals on survival in the wilderness, but few publications on conflict zones.
Travellers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure that they have valid travel documents for their return.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with a non-specified gender (X) or documents that have been updated to reflect the desired name and gender, is different.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognise these documents is also very different.
The searches at security checks have become more intrusive in the aftermath of 11 September 2001.
Transgender people should not expect that their privacy and dignity will be respected when passing through the scanners.
Riss currents are the return current of broken waves, often at reefs or similar.
Because of the underwater topography, the return flow concentrates in a few deeper areas and a rapid current can form there.
The majority of deaths occur as a result of exhaustion attempting to swim against the current, which is impossible.
If you leave the current, it is not difficult to return.
Ask yourself whether you can get somewhere where you are not caught. Alternatively, if you were noticed, you might wait for rescue.
The shock of return is earlier than the shock of culture shock (the honeymoon phase is not as pronounced), lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travellers who were able to adapt easily to the new culture find it difficult to adapt to their own culture.
When you return from a long-term stay abroad, you have adapted to a different culture and have abandoned some of the behaviours of your home culture.
As you travelled abroad for the first time, people were probably patient and understanding because they knew that travellers had to adapt to a new country.
You may not expect that returning travellers should be patient and understanding.
The sound and light show at the Pyramids is one of the most interesting attractions for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and while it is still quiet before the show begins.
Normally, you hear the sounds of tourists and vendors. The history of sounds and light is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx is used as a background and narrator of a long history.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids, and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The Southern Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most stations. In 2020, there were sixteen active.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the island of Guam.
More islands are Livingston Island and Deception, where the overflowing caldera of an active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbour.
Ellsworthland is the region south of the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula rise here and then divide into two, forming the 360 km long chain of Ellsworth mountains, which is divided by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part or the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak is the Mount Vinson, which has a height of 4892 m.
In remote areas without mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is not a substitute for a mobile phone, because you have to be in clear sight of a satellite to make a call.
The service is often used by ships, including pleasure boats, as well as expeditions that require data and voice links.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about the connection to this service.
An ever more popular option for people who are planning to take a year off is study and course offerings abroad.
This is particularly popular amongst graduates, as it allows them to take a year off before university without affecting their studies.
In many cases, participation in an overseas bridge year programme can actually improve your chances of obtaining a higher education in your home country.
In general, fees are charged for these educational programmes.
Finland is a great destination for boat tours. The "land of thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands - in the lakes and in the archipelagoes.
You do not need a yacht for the archipelagos and lakes.
In addition, even though the coastal island groups and the largest lakes are actually big enough for every yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is the national pastime in Finland, one in six or eight owns a boat.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the ratio is one to fourty.)
Most Eastbound cruises include a longer stay in St. Petersburg in Russia.
That means that you can visit the historical city for several whole days while you stay overnight on the ship.
If you only go on a tour of the countryside, you do not need a separate visa (Stand 2009).
Some cruises offer Berlin as a destination in Germany. You can see on the map above that Berlin is far from the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of a cruise.
Travelling by air can be a terrifying experience for people of any age and from any area of life, especially if they have never travelled or had a traumatic experience behind them.
It is nothing but the personal fears and prejudices that many people have.
To learn more about how aircraft work and the processes that take place during a flight can help some people to overcome their fear of the unknown or the feeling of not having control.
Courier companies are well paid for the fast delivery of things. Frequently, the time is a very important factor in corporate documents, trade goods or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the larger companies use their own aircraft, but on other routes and for smaller companies, difficulties occurred.
If they shipped their goods via air freight, the loading and customs clearance could take several days on some routes.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as abandoned luggage. The airline regulations do not allow passengers to send luggage without a passenger, and you come in to play.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to put a wad of cash on the table (or, better still, force your company to pay for it).
But that is not cheap: As a rough guide, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal Economy fare for the Business and the First Class for the first class!
It is pointless to look for discounts on direct flights from A to B, even if you are looking for business or first class seats.
The airlines know very well that there is a certain core group of passengers who are prepared to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting to their destination quickly and conveniently and demand appropriate prices.
The capital of Moldova is Kishinev. The native language is Romanian, but many people speak Russian.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic which has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
The 1994 conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
In spite of the failure of the political negotiations, economic relations between these two parts of the Republic of Moldova were restored.
The most important religion in Moldova is the Christian Orthodox.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transport hub.
The once ancient city of Smyrna is today a modern, progressive and prosperous business centre, which is surrounded by mountains and is located on a vast bay.
The wide boulevards, glass buildings and modern shopping malls are characterised by classic red tiled roofs, the market from the 18th century, as well as old mosques and churches, although the city is more characterised by a Mediterranean atmosphere than that of traditional Turkey." #
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
On the cemetery there are some interesting marble sculptures of birds.
It is worth spending half an hour wandering through the fascinating village.
In the north and close to it lies the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which was known to foreigners after Lord Byron described its beauty in vivid colours.
The Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly between Cabo da Roca and Sintra.
Visit also in the north the great shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (Pilgrimage site) – a place which is world famous for its Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are actually visiting a mass grave and a place of immense significance for a significant part of the world population.
There are still many men and women who have survived here, and many others with relatives who were murdered or died working, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat this place with the respect, reverence and respect it deserves. Don’t make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not vandalise the site by painting or scratching it.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants speak Catalan more often, the majority understand it, and almost everyone can speak Spanish.
Most of the signs are however only in Catalan, as it is legally established as the first official language.
Although Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other institutions.
Normal announcements are made in the Metro only in Catalan, but unforeseen disturbances are reported by an automatic system in a variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are said to be arrogant, egotistical and rude.
It is often said that this is only a stereotype, but you will find yourself in Paris much better if you show yourself as someone who is well-bred.
The rough exterior of Paris disappears quickly if you take basic manners into account.
The Plitwitzer Seen National Park is heavily forested, there are mainly oak, fir and pine and it offers a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
He has a remarkably diverse microclimate, a number of different soils and altitudes, and a great variety of plant communities.
The area is also home to a very large diversity of animal and bird species.
There are rare fauna such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynxes, wild cats and wild hens as well as many more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts that reach up to the knees and they must cover their shoulders.
In most monasteries there are no diapers for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially a brightly coloured one, the monk or nun will smile at you at the gate.
In this respect, men should wear trousers that reach below the knees.
These can be borrowed from the stock, but the clothes will not be washed after each user, so you may not feel comfortable in these shirts.
The mallorcan cuisine is based, as in similar areas of the Mediterranean, on bread, vegetables and meat (particularly pork) and uses always olive oil.
A simple and popular evening meal is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any available ingredient such as cheese, tuna etc.
All nouns begin with a capital letter for 'you' in the middle of a sentence.
This is a very important way of distinguishing between some verbs and objects.
It makes reading easier, but writing is a little bit difficult because you have to decide whether a verb or a noun is the main word.
The Italian pronunciation is relatively simple, since most of the words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters are c and g, because their pronunciation depends on the vowel following them.
Also, pay attention to the difference between r and rr: caro means ""love"" whereas carro means ""carriage"".
Persian has a relatively simple and largely regular grammar.
This book will help you to learn a lot about the Persian language and to understand better the expressions used in it.
If you speak a Romance language, it is obviously easier to learn Portuguese.
People who speak Spanish might be quick to conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that you don't have to learn it.
Ancient observatories are no longer in operation and are used as museums or educational institutions.
In the light pollution peak of its day, the problem of light pollution was not the problem it is today, but it is usually found in cities or on university grounds that are easier to reach than the newer buildings erected in recent times.
Most modern astronomical observatories are colossal structures in remote regions with favourable atmospheric conditions.
Hanami, the Japanese tradition of looking at the cherry blossoms, is a part of Japanese culture dating back to the eighth century.
The concept comes from China, where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first Cherry Blossom Festivals were held only for the imperial court and other members of the imperial family.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove just one.
If you visit a formally laid out garden and collect samples, you will also be thrown out without discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to live in and, once you arrive, almost everything can be bought.
You are in the extreme tropical regions and only a few degrees north of the equator, so you have to deal with both heat (always) and strong sun (rarely).
There are also a few buses that go northwards to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives
Make sure that the bus you want to take will go to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kirjat Arba.
Inter-regional waterways can be a good basis for holiday planning.
For example, a visit to the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or a cruise along the Erie Canal or a boat trip along the Thames.
They are also popular cycling and walking routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is considered to be the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with Christmas have been adopted by non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries.
There is a tradition to spend the Easter night at an open place to see the sunrise.
There are obviously Christian-theological explanations for this tradition, but it could also be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
Traditional churches often hold a midnight vigil on Good Friday, when the celebrations of the community begin at midnight, when the resurrection of Christ is celebrated.
All animals that originally came to the islands by swimming, flying or drowning here.
Because of the great distance from the continent, mammals were not able to travel, which made the giant tortoise the main grazing animal on the Galapagos Islands.
From the first people to enter the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise over the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, because the sky is dark all the time.
The areas are sparsely populated and the light pollution is not a problem, so you can also enjoy the starry sky.
The Japanese work culture is hierarchical and formal than what Westerners might be used to.
Business suits are the standard business attire and colleagues use their last names or job titles to address each other.
The harmony at work is essential, with the focus more on group performance than individual achievement.
Often, employees are expected to follow all decisions they make, without the consent of their superiors, and they are expected to obey their bosses' orders without question.
