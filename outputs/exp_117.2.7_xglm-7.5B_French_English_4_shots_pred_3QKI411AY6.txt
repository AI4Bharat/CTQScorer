The American Gymnastics Federation supports the letter of the United States Olympic Committee and accepts the absolute necessity of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We are in agreement with the statement of the USOC that our athletes and clubs, as well as their sport, could be better served. This can be done by going forward and by making substantive changes within our organisation rather than revoking accreditation.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that could make the light on how the abuse described so courageously by the survivors of Larry Nassar could have passed unnoticed for so long and adopts any necessary and appropriate change.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC share the same goal: making gymnastics, as well as other sports, as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive and responsible environment.

It confirms not only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already very widespread, but provides details that the fossils cannot usually provide, such as the colour and the tridimensional arrangement.
The scientists say that this bird's feathers were brown-tan on top and pale or carotenoid on the bottom.
This discovery also allows us to better understand the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a fully developed root, which is called a tail, but show other characteristics that are typical of feathers – feathers and feather-like tufts – the researchers have concluded that the tail was probably an evolutionary development later on.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight but rather for regulation or display of temperature. Researchers have suggested that even if this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not the down of a chick.
The scientists say that this is indeed the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, but the sample reveals a feather belonging to an adult, not a juvenile.
A car bomb exploded at the headquarters of the police in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and wounding more than twenty others.

The work done was primarily theoretical, but the programme was written to simulate the observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect sought would be caused by the tidal forces between the black matter of the galaxy and the black matter of the Milky Way.
As the moon exerts a pull on the earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a pull on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists concluded that the black matter affects other black matter in the same way as the normal matter.
According to this theory, most of the matter in the universe is in a sort of halo, and is made up of a large number of small particles.

Candidats may send representatives to attend each stage of the process. At night, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, according to specific procedures.

In the category of women sitting skiers, four skiers have not made it to the finish line; in the slalom, 45 skiers on a total of 117 in this race have not made it.
The police in Madhya Pradesh have recovered the laptop and mobile phone stolen.
The assistant inspector general D. K. Arya said: "We have arrested five people for having violated the Swiss citizen, and we have recovered her mobile phone and her laptop.
The accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the police commissioner, said that the accused had been covered up when they appeared before the court.
While three people were present in the house when the car crashed into it, no one was injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed to allow rescue services to extract the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrookes Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son by the Sheriff Court of Edinburgh.
She is in custody awaiting trial and her trial, but eyewitness testimony could be compromised because her portrait has been widely disseminated.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but the Scottish judiciary operates differently and the courts have considered that publishing photographs was potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, of Dundee University, notes that 'journalists seem to be following a dangerous line if they publish photographs, etc. of suspects'.
The Crown Prosecution Service said it would not make any comment at least until the prosecution is brought.
According to the leak, the document will deal with the dispute at the border that the Palestinians claim based on the existing borders before the Middle East war of 1967.
In addition to the other issues raised, there are the future State of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel requires a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of ten years from the signing of an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority only consents to a period of five years.
The shooters of the additional parasite test had to be closely monitored by rangers, as the test was controlled and its effectiveness was being evaluated.
In the context of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) inc., qualified volunteers were recruited, in the context of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting programme.
Mick O'Flynn, the temporary conservator of the park and heritage at NPWS, said that four shooters were chosen for the first round of shooting.
Martelly has just appointed a new provisional Electoral Council (CEP) consisting of nine members.
It is the fifth PEC of Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee recommended the dissolution of the previous CEP in the context of a set of measures aimed at engaging the country on the path of new elections.
This committee was the response of Martelly to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The violent protests sometimes have been triggered by the absence of elections, which were due to take place in 2011.
About 60 iPods malfunctioning cases have been reported, resulting in six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that it had been informed of 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, the METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which it had described as 'not serious'.
The Ministry of Finance has reacted by saying that it is'really regrettable' that the report has been postponed.
The earthquake struck the French Mariannes at 7:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The Emergency Management Office of the Northern Mariana Islands has stated that no damage has been reported in this country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has said there was no sign of a tsunami. 
A former Philippine police officer has taken hostages on a Hong Kong tourist bus in Manila, the Philippines' capital.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at tourists.
Many hostages have been rescued, and the death of at least six of them has been confirmed to date.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released prematurely, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took over the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the loo. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and became a doctor.
He has followed a training course in obstetrics, and has begun working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959." #
When he was working at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature births during his spare time. 
His research has shown that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the pulmonary maturation of the baby.
The Chinese news agency Xinhua reported that the government investigators recovered two flight recorders (or 'black boxes') on Wednesday.
Other fighters also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of the extreme. My first manager. Luna died on two moons. A unique moment, like her. A strong woman.
Dustin 'Goldust' Runnels commented that 'Luna was also strange as me... or even more... I love her and I'll miss her... I hope she rests in a better place.'
A survey conducted among 1,400 people before federal elections in 2010 revealed that the number of opponents to the transformation of Australia into a republic had increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard has said during the federal election campaign that she thought Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 per cent of those questioned share this view, and wish that Queen Elizabeth II is the last monarch to reign over Australia.
At the extremes of the poll, 29 per cent of those questioned think that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 per cent think that Australia should never become a republic.
The gold medallist was due to swim in 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his fitness was questioned.
He could not take the necessary medicines to overcome his pain, which were banned within the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, has just discovered the greatest number known to date.
Many people have checked the discovery using different equipment and software in February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
The comets may have been a source of water for the earth, as well as organic matter which can form proteins and promote life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, and particularly how the Earth was formed, because comets have collided with it for many years.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, 53, has begun his term in office this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He has described the rumours as 'political babblings and nonsense'.
We think he will be the next President.
According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that would allow aircraft to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, reducing carbon emissions.
It is based on satellite technology, and not on ground-based radar systems used previously, which allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more detailed information.
The additional transport is non-existent and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking and relay stations are not available on the ground.
The fear of not having enough transport has led to the possibility that the match could be played in an empty stadium, without the fans of the teams.
A study published on Thursday in Science has revealed the origin of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands.
A researcher from Princeton University in the United States and from Uppsala University in Sweden have indicated that the new species had evolved in only two generations, although this process had been estimated much longer, due to the reproductive interbreeding between a Darwin's finch endemic, Geospiza fortis, and the finch immigrant with a conical beak, Geospiza conirostris.
You can shape gold in many ways. It can be rolled into small pieces.
It can be twisted into fine thread, which can be bent and twisted. It can be hammered or laminated into sheets.
It can be made very fine, and glued onto another metal. It can be so fine that it has sometimes been used to decorate hand-painted images in manuscripts called "enlumined manuscripts.
That's what we call a chemical pH indicator. You can make one using carrot juice.
The colour of beetroot juice changes according to the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the chemical sample.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electron (because hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron)." #
Mix the dry powders together, then, with clean hands and moist ones, press them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will produce an odd sensation and produce a sort of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets equipped with a flush system in almost all houses, connected to a sophisticated se
Found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, were found pipes systems.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman times, public baths sometimes included toilets for men and women.
When you call someone who is thousands of kilometres away, you use a satellite.
The satellite receives the call in space and then returns it to Earth almost instantly.
The satellite was launched by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts a part of our light and our vision.
We need a giant rocket of more than 30 meters in height to put a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in many ways. The greatest benefit it has brought us is to have made transport much simpler and faster.
It has brought us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Below are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, including rabbits, deer and other cattle.
In addition, there are many small cats (including free-roaming cats) that eat the small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a special task assigned to each feline, preventing it from competing with other felines.
The lions are the most sociable cats, living in large groups called packs.
The packs are composed of one to three adult males, as well as a thirty-some females and cubs.
Women are generally very close to each other, their family being made up of a large number of sisters and daughters.
Lion troops act like packs of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in their behaviour, and also very deadly for their prey.
Balanced athlete, the tiger can jump (but sometimes difficultly), swim, run long distances and pull with five times the strength of a powerful human.
The tiger is part of the same family (genre Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones capable of roaring.
The roar of the tiger does not sound like the roar of the lion, but rather like a phrase whose words would be cries and groans.
The ocelot is fond of small animals. It catches monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if it can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than him.
According to scientists, ocelots hunt and find prey (prey) by smelling their tracks on the ground.
They see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision, and they move also very stealthily. The ocelots hunt their prey by blending into their environment before they leap on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it is derived (for example, if it moves over a mountain range or river, or if it moves to a new island, so that it cannot easily return to its former environment), it often finds itself in a different environment than it was previously.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so that the new population will need new characteristics or adaptations to be a powerful competitor against what it had previously needed.
The population of origin has not changed at all, it has always needed the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they will no longer be considered to belong to the same species.
We call this process'speciation', which simply means the formation of new species. The speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, expire).
Plants produce their food by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses and our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The great white shark was the superpredator of the time, he did not fear anything, except other great white sharks.
His long jaws were equipped with more than 70 sharp teeth, as well as a series of additional teeth in the palate, so that anything that crossed his path could not escape.
We are not sure, but it may well have been a tongue-twister.
It attacked everything that was in water; even a dinosaur like a T. rex was not big enough against him.
While the Romans ate food that we know, they ate strange or unusual dishes, including deer, pigeons, snails, and cockroaches, as well as the hare, a sort of rodent.
Another difference: while the poor and the woman ate their food sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to organise banquets where they rested on the side while they ate.
The Roman meals of antiquity could not include these foods from the United States or Asia which have been introduced in Europe centuries later.
For example, they did not have wheat, tomatoes, potatoes, or cacao, and no ancient Romans have ever tasted pork.
The Babylonians built temples for each of their gods, which were considered to be the dwellings of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to answer the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivities.
Each temple had a courtyard, then a inner sanctum to which only priests could access.
Some pyramids, ziggourats, were sometimes built as part of a temple.
The summit of the tower was a special place for the god.
In the hot, torrid climate of the Middle East, the home was not so important.
The majority of the Jewish family’s life was spent in the open air.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were only open counters giving on the street. Houses were built of stones. 
As there were no great forests in Canaan, the wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In Scandinavian sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder that he found Greenland - and named it - on his travels further west.
But, apart from the discovery itself, there were already tribus esquimaudes living in that time.
While each country is 'Nordic', there are many differences between the people, the kings, the customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the film Benjamin Gates and the Templar Treasure, you may think that a treasure map has been drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that is not true. Although there is an inscription on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, it read 'Original Declaration of Independence dated 4 July 1776'. The text is on the bottom of the document, reversed.
While no one knows who wrote it, it is known that at an early stage of its existence, the great scroll (which measures approximately 29 inches three quarters on 24 inches) was rolled up. 
It is therefore likely that the rating was added simply as an indication.
The landing day and the subsequent battles freed the north of France, but the south was still not free.
She was ruled by French collaborators, French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupying power instead of facing it.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies landed in southern France, an invasion called Operation "Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French Forces had liberated the south of France and were heading for Germany.
A civilisation is a culture shared by a large number of people who live and work in cooperation, a society.
The word 'civilisation' derives from the Latin word 'civis', which means civil and is related to the Latin words 'civis', which means citizen, and 'civitas', which means city or state. 
Cities-states are the pioneers of nations. A civilisational culture involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a durable cultural empreinte and a fair distribution.
Minority cultures are often lost without leaving any historically relevant traces and are not recognised as genuine civilisations.
In the revolutionary war, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government — the Congress being its only component — under the Articles of the Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes, and as there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on the authorities of the state, often less cooperative, to enforce all its acts.
He did not have the power to derogate from tax laws or from customs duties between Member States.
Articles required unanimous consent of all Member States before they could be amended and Member States took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, with Germany's national team, the second most successful team in the world and they have won the World Cup of FIFA in 2006.
In popular sports, football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, equestrian sports, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 are included.
Skiing is the most popular sport in the northern regions, Italians participating in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has 7, 000 islands (the largest being Honshu), which makes it the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the islands that make up this group, Japan is often referred to as an 'archipelago'.
The first information about Taiwan date back to the 15th century, while European sailors passing through the area made mention of it as Ilha Formosa, or 'beautiful island'.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the south-west of Taiwan, introducing a transformation of traditional practices of rice production and employing Chinese labourers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared it a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the first Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Treaty, by which it ceded Taiwan to Japan, which was then in charge of the island until 1945.
The Inca citadel is made up of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the sun temple and the three-window room.
Most of the buildings adjacent to the complex have been rebuilt to give visitors a better view of their original appearance.
In 1976, 30 % of the Machu Picchu had been restored and this restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format of photographic film is 35 mm; it was the most common format of film used in the analogue era.
It is still made today, but what is important is that its image format is inherited from the format of the digital camera sensors.
The 35 mm format is in fact, and it is quite surprising, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
So it is said that the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by 12 to obtain the simplest of integer ratios) is 3:2.
Many common formats (APS family, for example) are equal to this aspect ratio or are close to it.
The third country rule, which has been abused and often ridiculed, is a simple directive which offers dynamism and protection at the same time.
He says that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the vertical and horizontal lines dividing the image.
In this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was being questioned.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has bound the European states together despite the differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power touched everyone, from the king to the roturier.
One of the Christian principles is that wealth should be used to relieve suffering and poverty and that the church's money is there specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church was in Rome for more than 1000 years and this concentration of power and money has led many people to ask whether this doctrine was respected.
After hostilities began, Britain put in place a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategy has proved effective, cutting vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade has been flagrantly violating the generally accepted international law and codified by several international treaties of the two last centuries.
The United Kingdom has been engaged in a campaign of minelaying in international waters to prevent ships from venturing into entire areas of international waters, which represents a threat even to neutral ships." #
As this tactic has not elicited a timid reaction, Germany expected a similar reaction from its submarine warfare without limits.
In the 20th century, most citizens and nations showed a preference for pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of the War during the First World War, the nations wished to avoid such a situation from recurring in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four hundred dollars in his name, a poetry book and a recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his previous employer) to Thomas Edison.
The ancient Chinese had a unique way of showing the different periods of China or each family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
There were also periods of instability between dynasties. The most famous of these periods is the period of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty.
In these periods, fierce battles have been fought between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms were one of the bloodiest periods in Chinese history. Thousands of people died in battle to sit on the throne of the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political repercussions such as the use of the metric system, the passage from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people and not to one single leader.
As well, after the Revolution, the professions were opened to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
It is the same for the army, because the ranking of armies is no longer based on class, but on calibre.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-classes in other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions that transcended the scope of this worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that became famous under the name of 'Hira' on the mountain of 'Noor' (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad’s spiritual inclinations.
located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It is not easy to find, even though we know that it exists. When we entered the cave, we were completely isolated.
Up there, you can only look at the clear sky and the numerous mountains surrounding it. From the inside of the cave, you can only see or hear very little of this universe.
The Great Pyramid of Gizeh is the only one of the seven wonders that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid of Egypt was built by the Egyptians during the third millennium BC. It is one of the many gigantic structures erected in honour of the Pharaohs who died.
The Giza plateau, or 'Giza necropolis', in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, contains several pyramids (the largest being the most imposing), several small tombs, many temples and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built to honour the pharaoh Khéops, and many small pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honour his wives and family.
The symbol 'push' looks like a V and the symbol 'pull' looks like a staple or a square with a missing bottom.
The top means that you must start with the tip and push the bow, and the bottom means that you must start with the arrow and pull the bow.
A bow upwards produces a softer sound, while a bow downwards produces a louder sound.
Don't hesitate to write your own marks on the pencil, but remember that musical pencil marks are for a musical reason, and that you should generally respect them.
On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, his wife Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old), and the sister of the King, Madame Elisabeth, all terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by
In a carriage they went back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and screamed threats against the king and the queen.
The king and the queen were forced to open the windows of their carriages because of the crowd.
At some point, a crowd member brandished the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles before the terrified queen.
The US imperialist war expenditures in the Philippines have been paid by the people of the Philippines themselves.
They were forced to pay colonial US taxes to cover a large part of the expenses and interest payments on the Philippine government bonds issued by Wall Street banks.
Of course, the superprofits derived from prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people could constitute the fundamental benefits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we must understand the context in which they were founded.
These events took place during the period generally considered to be the High Middle Ages – a period of European history from the 1000s to 1300s.
The Middle Ages Central was preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Low Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from the technological push or the imperative to a strict sense of the term, according to which the destiny of humanity is dictated by a logical underpinning linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technological developments.
The majority of interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: that technological development itself is a process that transcends cultural and political influences, and that technology has an impact on societies that are intrinsically conditioned rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we could say that the car is a necessary part of the road development.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a few cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Massive car ownership also leads to an increased incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the field of health care for treating the body injuries.
Romanticism presented an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
According to Romantic theories, geography has shaped the individuals and, over time, customs and a culture associated with that geography have emerged. These, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris is known as the capital of the world’s fashionable contemporary, Constantinople was considered as the capital of the European feudal.
His reputation as the centre of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until 1100 AD.
His status has declined over the twelfth century, mainly because the Crusaders returned with presents such as silk and spices, which the Byzantine markets could not compete with.
At that time, the title of the capital of fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic architecture flourished between the 10th and 11th century and the 14th century.
At first, the dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture, to the east.
However, due to the slowness of communication means, Western modes could have been behind by 25 to 30 years.
In the Middle Ages, Western Europe developed its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time, following the Crusades, was the use of buttons for closing clothing.
A subsistence farming system is a system of farming practiced to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Agriculture of subsistence is a simple system, often organic, using traditional seeds preserved from the region, combined with rotational or other simple techniques to maximise yield.
Historically, most farmers practised subsistence farming and it is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures gather people feeling neglected by social norms and sharing the same ideas which allows them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnic origin, class, location and / or sex of members.
The criteria that determine a subculture as distinctive can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
The members of a subculture often signal their membership by a distinctive style, which includes modes, maniérismes and slang.
One of the most common ways of illustrating the importance of socialisation is to draw on a few unfortunate cases of children who, by negligence, misfortune or deliberate abuse, have not been socialised by adults during their childhood.
These children are considered to be "wild" or "wild." Some children were locked up by people (usually their own parents) ; in some cases, abandonment of this child was due to the rejection by parents of a severe intellectual or physical handicap which the child suffered.
Wild children may have suffered serious abuse or trauma before being abandoned or escaping.
Others would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in the wild.
When they are raised entirely by non-human species, wild children display almost identical behaviours (in the limits of their physical capacities) to those of the species which raised them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
As the project-based learning should make learning more easy and more interesting, the support goes further.
Support is not a method of learning but rather a means of helping learners who discover a new teaching method such as the use of a new programme or the beginning of a new project.
Supports can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but the little Microsoft Office guy is also one.
Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are intended to guide, explain and guide students through procedures that could have been too difficult to manage by the student alone.
Children are placed in foster homes for very diverse reasons which go from neglect to maltreatment, from extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, attentive and educational, but that is the case.
We see family placement as a safe zone for these children.
Our family placement system is supposed to provide safe, loving carers, stable education and reliable health care.
Placement in family homes is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were previously removed.
Internet combines mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approach to use and gratifications.
For example, 'learning' and'socialization' are seen as major factors promoting the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and continuing relationships were also identified as being new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied the public reactions to the Internet sites.
Video recording has led to great discoveries in the interpretation of facial expressions, that is, facial expressions during a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect if a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, has indicated how people with cerebral lesions are able to assess the sincerity of the speech with precision.
He suggests that such human behavioural interpretation abilities may be found in domestic dogs.
Research conducted in the twentieth century has shown that there are two genetic reservoirs: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the reserve of genetic variations expressed.
Segregation and recombination alternate between the two basins at every generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet its protein needs from available plant resources.
In addition, a lack of response has serious consequences: growth disturbances, malnutrition and ultimately, death.
The most easily accessible resources would be the proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult to digest for us, unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal feed (ants, termites, eggs) is easy to digest and provides a large amount of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
In all fairness, we should not be surprised if our own forefathers have resolved their 'protein problem' in a similar way that chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentional waking during your sleep and then falling back asleep (from 10 to 60 minutes).
It can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock, so that you can wake up without waking up completely.
If you find yourself resetting your clock during your sleep, it may be placed on the other side of the room, making it impossible for you to get out of bed to turn it off.
The other possibilities based on the circadian rhythm include drinking a lot of liquids before going to bed (particularly water or tea, reputed to be diuretics), which forces you to wake up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace of a person is opposed to the degree of tension in his or her body and mind.
When the tension is low, the present vitality is positive. Each person has the possibility to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way is our own tension and our negativeness.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been enriched by the mahayana path and by many Indian techniques of yoga.
In principle, the Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the universal love path.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (illumination energy) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The Tibetan centre of meditation is the yoga of the goddess. It is through visualising different goddesses that the channels of energy are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the awakened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy during the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. At the end of the war, deep conflicts between their different systems, methods and cultures led to the end of the entente between these two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the old allies have become enemies and the Cold War has begun.
It would last for the next 40 years and see real battles, through proxy armies, on battlefields in Africa as well as Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and in many other places.
On September 17, Poland was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian head of the bridge.
But these plans have become obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800 000 Red Army soldiers arrived and created the Bieloruss-Ukrainian front after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, as well as other international treaties, whether bilateral or multilateral, that are bilateral or multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is the most effective way to move large amounts of people and goods across oceans.
The work of the armed forces has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the capacity to move your people and your goods, while interfering with your enemy's capacity to move his people and his goods.
One of the most recent examples of this situation has been the North Atlantic campaign during the Second World War. The Americans tried to cross the Atlantic Ocean to send soldiers and equipment to help Great Britain.
At the same time, German naval forces, using mainly U-boats, were trying to stop this trade.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Great Britain as it did for the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were domesticated for the first time around 10, 000 years ago in the Zagros mountains in Iran.
The cultures and the ancient tribes began to keep them close to them so that they could easily access milk, fur, skins and meat.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds which wandered on hills or other pastures, often being cared for by shepherds who were usually children or adolescents, similar to the more familiar term of shepherds.
The 'wagonways' were built in England in the 16th century.
While the railway wagons were simply made of parallel planks, they allowed horses to reach greater speeds and to carry heavier loads than on the slightly more accident-prone roads of the day.
The cross-ties were introduced early enough to keep the runways in place. However, it was soon apparent that the runways would be more effective if they were provided with a steel plate on the top.
It has become a common practice, but iron has caused more wear on the wooden wheels of wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron wheels were introduced.
The first means of locomotion was walking: humans began to walk upright about two million years ago with the arrival of the Homo Erectus ("right-handed man").
Their predecessors, the australopithecines, did not walk upright as they were used to.
There are bipedal specializations in fossils of Australopithecus from 4,2 to 3,9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs already seven million years ago.
We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even campaign in the aim of mitigating the sufferings to come.
In many cases, it is a symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not just want a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems and disable them.
It is clear that the world has changed thanks to the scientific and technological achievements made by human beings, and that the problems have become more serious because of the overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a manuscript signed by the House Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to a few blocks away, to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
In the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, known as "Dunlap Broadsides.
The public reading of the document was held by John Nixon in the Independence Hall on 8 July.
One of them was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who read it to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy reached London on 10 August.
The 25 sheets Dunlap that we know of are the oldest known copies of the document. The original manuscript copy has not survived.
A lot of paleontologists now believe that a dinosaur group survived and is still alive. They are called birds.
Many people regard them as dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly.
But there are many things on birds which look like a dinosaur.
They have scales on their feet and claws, they lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like T-Rex.
Every computer used today is based on the manipulation of information which is encoded in binary form.
A binary number can only have one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary numbers, or bits for using the computer jargon.
An internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are sufficiently general to allow a diagnosis to be made without delay.
The best indicator of an internal poisoning is probably the presence of a closed container of toxic household chemicals.
Look at the label to find out the specific first aid instructions for this poison.
The term 'insect' is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term 'parasite' derives from an old familiarity with bed bugs, which are very adapted to parasitise humans.
The flies, like bed bugs, are nidicolous, that is to say, adapted to live in the nest or the host's home.
In the United States, there are approximately 400 000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which makes it the principal neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
The ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) is a central nervous system disease that affects the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have MS than men.
A couple can very well estimate that it is not in their interest, nor in the child’s, to take care of the education of a baby.
These couples can choose to adopt their baby.
In adoption, biological parents end their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main objective of science is to understand how the world works by means of scientific methods. This method guides in fact most scientific research.
But it is not the only experiment, and an experiment is a test which serves to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, to pose questions and to make observations, but which also orients the scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers have concentrated on ancient texts, and in particular on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle’s opinions on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
With the decline of Greek knowledge, the West has been cut off from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behaviour depend in large part on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which do not simply respond to external stimuli, have been shown to be present in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to operate for a certain period even when there is no external stimulus.
The experience of Hershey and Chase was one of the main indications that DNA was a living matter.
Hershey and Chase used viruses or phages to implant their own DNA into a bacteria.
They have conducted two experiments to mark either the phage DNA with a radioactive phosphorus, or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the extent of the affected material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only germ cell mutations can be passed on to children, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism is aimed at those who wish to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, in particular wildlife and flora.
Hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying the ecosystem are examples of activities on site.
You can, for example, go and see, photograph and discover the orang-utans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small towns of countryside by car to go to their place of work and cross other people who are going to work in the country they have just left.
In this dynamic passenger transport system, everyone is in some way connected to a personal car-based transport system and supports it.
The science now shows that this massively carbon-based economy has pushed the biosphere out of its stable state that has supported human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is part of the society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about the quality of the water or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they fail to work every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flows are the study of the movements of drivers and private vehicles between two points, and the interactions they exert between themselves.
It is unfortunately difficult to study the flow of traffic because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with a hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act in a reasonable range; so, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable coherence and can be represented mathematically approximatively.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) the flow, (2) the density and (3) the speed.
These relationships help to plan, design and operate road infrastructures.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly enabled them to escape more easily from their enemies and to find more effectively food and companions.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their bodies.
It gives them a greater number of small hiding places.
Today, only dragonflies and ephemerals can fold their wings.
There are some 6,000 years ago, a man called Aristarchus said that the solar system moved around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but many thought he was wrong: that the solar system moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
It seems reasonable, because the Earth does not feel the slightest movement, is it not?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times the volume of water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the world's largest river, reaching up to 10 km wide.
At least 20 percent of the water that falls from rivers on the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main branch of the Amazon River is 6 387 km (3 980 miles). It collects the water of thousands of small rivers.
although the construction of pyramids in stone continued until the end of the Ancient Empire, the Great Pyramid of Gizeh has never been surpassed in size and the technical perfection of its construction.
Ancient Egyptians were enchanted by the monuments of their predecessors, who had then been building them for more than a thousand years.
Vatican City has around 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and the least populated.
The Vatican City State drafts its legislation and official communications in Italian.
Italian is also the language of everyday use by most of the state employees, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
The citizens of the Vatican City are all Catholics.
From antiquity, people have been familiar with basic elements such as gold, silver and copper, because they are found in nature as raw materials and are relatively simple to mine using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, has theorised that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. It was earth, water, air and fire.
It was rather the four states of matter (in the same order) that he had in mind: solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although he also had the theory that these latter would transform into new substances to form what we see.
The alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys which contain a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of minuscule particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that billions of them could enter this period at the end of this sentence.
So, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it was released.
Unfortunately, the appearance of new modes of writing has marginalized the pen to a more private status and has been used less often.
People now write their messages on computer screens, never having to get close to a pencil.
It is hard to imagine what the keyboard will become when the next new thing comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it combines a nucleus of a myriad of protons and neutrons.
Like if you were to make a hill climb by a heavy cart. Dividing the core again, then releasing some of this energy.
Some atoms have a highly unstable nucleus, so that they tend to break up with little or no pressure.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust. Its outer layer is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the visible side and 100 km on the hidden side.
It is finer at sea and thicker under the continents.
There may be more lava on the side close to the crater because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centred on the search for what makes people feel good or attracted.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they matured into adulthood.
These theories examine what drives some people to want what they do and what drives them to do or not do certain things in their environment.
Two popular theories of content are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviours can emerge when a manager becomes the boss of former colleagues. At one extreme is trying to stay 'the good friend' (or 'the good friend's').
A manager of this type is not able to take unpopular decisions, carry out disciplinary actions, carry out evaluations, delegate responsibilities, and hold others responsible.
At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes a person who is unrecognizable, who feels that he/she must change everything that the group has created up to now and do things his/her way.
So, the boss is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behaviour often leads to friction between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical team.
They have often more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet at different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a real "invisible" team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
The 'invisible team' is the team of management which each member reports to. It sets the standards for each of them.
Why would an organisation want to create a learning organisation? One of the objectives of implementing organisational learning concepts is innovation.
When all the available resources are used efficiently in the functioning of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can be expressed fully.
In other words, the process of working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
Before an organisation can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and its own culture of learning.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organisations achieve better results.
The neurobiological data provide material evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. They thus allow for a reduction in the research field and make it much more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research.
We know for a long time that different types of damage, lesions, tumours and brain trauma affect the behaviour and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies has enabled us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
It gives us a lot of information and material to build models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although Artificial Intelligence is often strongly connoted with science-fiction, it represents a very important part of computer science which studies the behaviour, learning and adaptability of intelligent machines.
The research in artificial intelligence aims at automating tasks requiring an intelligent approach.
In addition to the examples mentioned above, there are the control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to customer needs, and recognition of writing, voice and face.
These practices have led to distinct disciplines, oriented towards the provision of solutions to everyday problems.
The artificial intelligence system is now increasingly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and military, as it was put into practice in several home computer software and video games.
Excursions are integral to any school. Often, a teacher would like to take his students to places where a bus journey is not possible.
The solution is provided by the technology in the form of virtual educational outings. Students can view the ancient artifacts of a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a beautiful work of art while sitting in their classroom.
Participating practically to a trip is also a good way to reflect on a trip and to share your experiences with future generations.
For example, students at Bennett High School in North Carolina design and maintain a website each year dedicated to their visit to the capital of the state. Each year, the site is updated, but the old versions are kept online for archival purposes.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Even if students often try blogging with poor grammar and spelling, the fact that they have a public makes it more likely that the situation will improve.
As students are often the most critical of the blog, the author is trying to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging "forces students to better understand the world around them" and "encourages students to be intelligent and interesting." The need to stimulate public interest encourages students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are an effective tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning well beyond the traditional school day.
When used effectively, blogs can help students to strengthen their analytical and critical thinking skills: by responding actively to online content, they can confront their own opinions with those of others and expose their own views on specific topics.
Ottawa is the charming capital bilingual of Canada and has a large number of art galleries and museums which highlight the past and present of Canada.
You will find further south the falls of Niagara and further north, the Muskoka region and its environs which possess a virgin natural beauty.
All these measures, and many more, make Ontario what the foreigners regard as the quintessence of Canada.
A large part of the northern regions are quite sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited in the wild.
For a comparison that will surprise you: there are more African-Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean, close to the African coast.
Madagascar is by far the largest country, and even a continent to itself, in terms of wildlife.
Most of the small islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known for being luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam into the lands and this religion has spread widely to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 14th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route linking Europe to India.
North, the region is delimited by the Sahel, and to the south and to the west by the Atlantic Ocean.
To women: It is recommended that any woman who travels should say that she is married, irrespective of her marital status.
It is also advisable to wear an alliance (which should not seem too precious.
Women must realise that some cultural differences may lead to behaviours they consider as harassment. It is indeed common that they are followed, caught by the arm, etc.
Be firm in your refusal of advances from men, and do not be afraid to hold your ground (cultural or not, it does not mean that it is acceptable!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Ptolemies, the Romans and the Merovingians as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese, who after it had destroyed it had rebuilt it and named it Casa Branca, finally abandoned it in 1755 after a quake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city under the name of Daru l-Badya, and it was renamed Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco for shopping.
Around the old medina, you can easily find traditional Moroccan products, such as tajines, pottery, leather goods, and all kinds of jewellery, but it is all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located in the extreme east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano which buried most of the streets of the city, in particular the city centre.
Although Goma is reasonably secure, any visit to the outside of Goma must be subject to investigation to understand the state of the fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of Nyiragongo volcano as well as for the tracking of mountain gorillas among the least expensive in Africa.
You can use boda-bodas to get around in Goma. The normal fare (local) is about 500 CDF for a small trip.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, 'Tombouctou' has become a metaphor for distant and exotic countries.
Today, Tombouctou is a poor city, although its reputation as a tourist attraction has made it a popular destination, and it has a small airport.
In 1990, it was added to the world heritage list in danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main steps in the series 'African Wonders' broadcast by Henry Louis Gates on the PBS.
The city contrasts markedly with the rest of the country, since it has a more Arab style than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and runs along the Mozambique border to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River border.
The total area of the park is 19 500 km2, divided into 14 ecozones, each of which contains a specific fauna.
This is one of the most famous South African National Parks and regarded as the jewel in the SANParks crown.
As for all South African national parks, there are daily entry and conservation fees.
It may be advantageous to obtain a Wild Card that allows access to some South African national parks, as well as to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the name of the territory of Hong Kong and represents the main centre of interest for many tourists.
The row of buildings that forms the horizon of Hong Kong was compared to a glittering bar chart, which is revealed by reflection in the Victoria harbour.
To admire the most beautiful views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to Kowloon's seafront located in front.
The majority of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the northern side of the harbour.
This is the place that the British colonists have occupied. Thus, it seems to be a good starting point, if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this region.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest mangrove forest belt, extending for 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the back-country of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of the forest located on Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
Forests, however, are not only composed of mangrove swamps: they also contain some of the last vestiges of the majestic jungles that covered the vast plains of the Ganges in
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3 850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water/wetlands.
Sundarbans is a protected area since 1966, you will find there about 400 Bengal tigers and 30 000 spotted deer.
The buses leave the district bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, but most, especially those that serve the east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6 and 7 a.m.
Inter-city buses are often full, so it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese ships, which are comfortable and robust.
The shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to get to places nearby, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock Bridge is a suspension bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to link the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint George's in Guyana.
The two towers stand at a height of 83 metres; they are 378 metres long and have two lanes of 3,50 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. The structure was completed in August 2011, but it was opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge should be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs posts should be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group living in what is now the eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also practising subsistence agriculture.
Other tribes of indigenous peoples who populated the Chaco, such as the Guaycurú or the Payaguá, survived mainly by fishing, hunting, or gathering.
In 1516, Paraguay was called 'the giant province of the Indies', born of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the indigenous peoples.
The Spaniards inaugurated the period of colonisation, which lasted three centuries.
From the foundation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain a large part of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best teams and among the best players in polo in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
In addition, smaller tournaments and matches are sometimes organised here at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, please visit the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Isle of Man is the Manx Pound (FKP), which is equivalent to a pound sterling (GBP)." #
The money can be exchanged at the sole bank in Stanley, opposite the FIC West shop.
The pound sterling is a widely accepted currency in the islands, while in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the nearby islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, even if it is possible that British and American dollars will be accepted. Talk to the owners in advance to agree on a payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange money from the Maldives outside the islands, so change it before you leave the islands.
Montevideo being located south of the Equator, the winter in the northern hemisphere corresponds to the summer there and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical zone and summer temperatures are common.
Winter can be misleadingly cold: temperatures rarely fall below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to give the impression that it is colder than what the thermometer says.
There is no such thing as a 'rainy season' or 'dry season': rainfall is pretty constant all year round.
While many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, they are wild animals; please do not feed them or disturb them.
According to the authorities of the park, you must stay at least 100 metres away from wolves and bears and at least 25 metres away from all other wild animals!
As they may appear to be so docile, the bison, elk, reindeer, wolf and almost all the great animals can attack.
Every year, hundreds of visitors are injured because they do not keep a sufficient distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them some space.
In addition, know that odours attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid transporting or cooking odours-producing foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of about 40 000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and is the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a tragic naval standoff in 1889, when seven German, American and British ships refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
The supreme chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was assassinated during a peaceful gathering in the city, during the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement.
The beaches are numerous, for Auckland is on the border of two ports. The most popular ones are found in three zones.
The North Shore beaches are on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay north to Devonport south.
Every beach is sandy and safe to swim in, and most are shaded by the Pohutukawa.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the affluent Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in the heart of Auckland.
The beaches, sometimes very frequented by families, have many shops along the coast. Swimming is safe there.
The main local beer is the 'Number One', a rather ordinary beer, but tasty and refreshing. There is also another local beer, the 'Manta'.
There are many French wines to taste, but New Zealand and Australia wines may travel better.
You can drink the local tap water without any risk, but you can easily find bottled water if you have any concerns about it.
For Australians, the idea of a 'coffee cream' is foreign. A black coffee is an 'espresso', a cappuccino is filled with cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is Belgian standard. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many voyages are made on the reef all year round, and injuries caused by one of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, obey all signs and pay attention to safety warnings.
From October to April, the box jellyfish arrive near beaches and river estuaries. They can also sometimes be seen outside this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most of them are afraid of humans and would run away.
Salmon crocodiles do not live in the ocean, their main habitat is in estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travellers the peace of mind that they will have somewhere to sleep once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have special agreements with specific hotels, but you can also book accommodation through travel agents of other types, such as camping sites.
Travel agencies usually offer packages including breakfast, transport from/to the airport or even packages combining flight and accommodation.
They can also hold your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or to procure other documents necessary for your destination (for example, a visa).
Any modification or request must however be addressed to the travel agency first and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants decide to camp on site, and most consider that this is an integral part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the musical event, you will have to arrive early to find a good camping site.
Don't forget that even if the music concerts are over on the main stages, other music concerts can continue until late at night on other festival sites.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the Baltic Sea in winter, be sure to check the location of the hut, because the crossing of the ice can cause unbearable noise at the most exposed huts.
Cruises to St Petersburg include time spent in the city. Passengers on cruises are exempt from the visa requirement (see the conditions).
Casinos generally make a lot of efforts to maximise the time and money spent by their customers. There are rarely windows and clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They generally offer special offers of food, drinks and entertainment to maintain the good mood of guests and keep them there.
On some sites, it is the premises that offer free alcoholic beverages. However, drunkenness impairs judgement, and all good players should know that it is crucial to remain sober.
Anyone who travels in a car to high latitudes or crosses mountain passes must consider the possibility of snow, ice or cold temperatures.
On the icy roads and icy conditions, friction is low and you cannot drive like you were on the asphalt.
While the blizzards are raging, it can fall in very little time enough snow to block you.
The visibility can also be limited by snowfall or by the accumulation of snow or ice on the windows of vehicles.
In addition, the presence of ice and snow is normal in many countries, and the traffic is practically uninterrupted all year round.
Safaris are perhaps the most popular tourist attraction in Africa and the most memorable moment for many visitors.
Safari" is a colloquial term for an African excursion, and in particular for an African safari, which aims to witness the spectacular spectacle of wild animals in their natural habitat.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach close to cars and the standard equipment allows for good observation.
 Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes timid and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as 'walking safari', 'footing' or 'trekking') consists of walking, either for a few hours, or for several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, after hosting the Games in 1964.
If you have booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you will be facing a difficult situation.
The cancellation policies vary, but from mid-March, most cancellation policies based on the coronavirus do not extend to July 2020, the date when the Olympic Games had been planned.
We expect that most events tickets will cost between EUR 2 500 and EUR 130 000, while typical event tickets will cost approximately EUR 7 000.
After washing the wet clothes, you can dry them more easily. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards that can be borrowed, even if there are no such facilities in the rooms.
If you don't have a iron or don't want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if you find one.
Do not let the fabric overheat (which can cause its shrinkage or in extreme cases, burn it).
There are various methods of water purification, including some which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it is enough to boil the water for a minute; in others, it is necessary to boil it for several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you have a problem, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter pests they do not know in their home region.
Parasites can contaminate food, cause irritations or, in the most serious cases, cause allergic reactions, spread venom or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals which can wound or kill people by force, are not usually considered parasites.
In some areas, duty free shops present an opportunity to buy exempt goods and excise duties.
Travellers to countries where the taxes are high can sometimes save a great deal of money, in particular on alcoholic drinks or tobacco products.
The Buffalo-Pittsburgh section of the Buffalo-Toronto highway is the most difficult section of the highway on Buffalo-Toronto, passing through isolated backcountry areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your mind open: the steep hills, narrow roads and tight curves prevail.
Speed limits displayed are significantly lower than in previous rounds and following – usually between 35 and 40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and strict compliance is even more important than before.

Indonesia having 17 000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines present in all of the country.
However, when this term is used without any other qualifying term, it tends to refer to foodstuffs from the central and eastern parts of the island of Java.
Now, widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a range of simple dishes, the predominant flavours being the cashews, the peppers, the sugar (especially the coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are foot rests for the rider, which hang from each side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability to the user, but they can pose a security problem: in fact, the user's feet can get stuck in the footrest.
If a rider is thrown from a horse, but has a leg caught in the stirrup, he could be dragged if the horse escapes. To minimise this risk, a number of measures of security can be taken.
Firstly, most horses wear riding boots with a flat sole and a narrow heel.
In addition, some saddles, in particular English saddles, have safety bars which allow a stirrup to fall from the saddle if it is pulled back by a rider who falls.
Valley of Cochamó – The destination of excellence for climbing in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with many different granite peaks and cliffs.
From the top of the mountains, the panoramas are unparalleled. The alpinists of the world know how to find new routes on the slopes, where the possibilities are endless. 
Skiing and snowboarding are popular sports that consist in sliding down a snowy slope with skis or snowboards attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity that has many fans, sometimes referred to as'ski bums', who organise their entire holidays around skiing in specific places.
The idea of skiing is very old: some prehistoric paintings show skiers dating for some of 5 000 years ago!
Skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 16th century; the first ski club in a recreational sense was founded in 1861 in Australia by Norwegians. 
Skiing: this activity is also known as Nordic skiing, cross-country skiing or mountaineering.
It resembles alpine skiing, as well as alpine climbing, but does not include these activities, which are practiced on rocky terrain and require the use of skis and boots that are much stiffer.
Think of skiing as a similar hiking route.
In good conditions, you can walk a little further than you can on foot – but you will rarely reach speeds of skiing without a heavy pack on a muddy slope.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but containing many independent countries. In normal circumstances, travelling through several countries involves the need to apply for several visas and to undergo several passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, works a little bit like one country in this regard.
As long as you are in this area you can usually cross the border without having to go through passport control.
In addition, having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply separately for each of the Member States of the Schengen area, which allows you to save time, money and administrative formalities.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique. Some tax authorities define antiquities as objects over 100 years old.
The criteria vary according to the place one is in; in some parts of the world, as in North America, the age limit can be lower than that in force in Europe.
Artisanal products can be considered as antiques even though they are less ancient than similar industrial products.
Ranging reindeer herding is an important means of livelihood for the Sami and the culture surrounding this trade is of great importance to many other professions.
Although, according to tradition, all Samis did not live in large-scale reindeer farming, they lived off fishing, hunting and other similar activities, while using reindeer mainly as livestock.
Today, many Samis are working in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Lapland, the Sami region.

Very unfavourable weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and they can be of several kinds, depending on the geographical, topographical and meteorological characteristics.
Violent winds, heavy rain, excessive precipitation and fires are the manifestations and effects of violent weather, just as tornadoes, hurricanes, cyclones and thunderstorms are.

It is strongly recommended that travellers check the weather in their destination region, knowing that it can have an impact on their itinerary.
Anyone considering travelling to a country which might be considered a war zone should receive a vocational training.
A search on the Internet for 'Cours in hostile environment' will probably lead to a local business.
A course will cover the topics raised here in much more detail, usually with a practical experience.
A training course normally lasts for two to five days and includes role playing, lots of first aid, and sometimes a training in the use of weapons.
Wildlife books and magazines are commonplace, but there are few books and magazines on war zones.
Passengers who are planning to undergo a gender reassignment abroad should ensure that they have in their possession valid travel documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with the gender of the bearer not indicated (X) or to update documents to reflect the bearer' s name and gender wishes varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honour these documents is also variable.

People may not be anticipating that patience and understanding are also necessary for travellers and travellers returning home.
The show and light show at the Pyramid is one of the region's most interesting attractions for children.
You can see the pyramids in the darkness and you can see them in silence before the show begins.

The Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the largest number of research stations and 16 are active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The island of King George, with the village of Villa Las Estrellas, is the largest.
Other examples: Livingston Island and the disappointment, where the inland caldera of an active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbour.
Ellsworth Land is the southern part of the peninsula, defined by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula are melted into the plateau, then reappear to form the Ellsworth Mountains, which run for 360 kilometres and are crossed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel chain contains the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which stands at 4892 m.

Finland is a popular destination for recreational boating. The "Land of the thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, in lakes and in coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht in the archipelagoes and lakes.
While the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are actually quite large for a boat, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Sailing is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden and New Zealand are in the same situation, but apart from that, it is a unique case (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one to 40).
Most cruises on the Baltic Sea are characterised by a prolonged stay in St Petersburg, in Russia.

It is not shameful to admit that this is not different from personal fears and fears that many people have about other things.
Some people may find it helpful to understand something about the workings of aircraft and what happens during a flight to overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or on the fact that you do not have control.
The freight companies are well paid to deliver fast. Often, in an urgent repair, the question of time is crucial for documents, goods or spare parts that relate to them.
On some routes, large companies have their own aircraft, but on other routes and for small companies there has been a problem.
If they had sent goods by air, on some routes, it would have taken days to clear customs and to get the goods to the destination.
The only way to do it was to send it as registered baggage. Airline regulations will not allow them to send a bag without a passenger, and that's where you intervene.
The easiest way to travel first class or business class is to pay a big sum of money for that privilege (or, better still, ask your company to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: generally you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class and eleven times for first class!
Generally, it is pointless to try to get discounts for business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that they can count on certain types of passengers who are prepared to pay very high prices for the privileges of speed and comfort, and they set their prices in good faith.
The capital of the Republic of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is very widespread.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that is suffering from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, equipped with its own government and currency, but recognised by no member state of the United Nations.
The economic ties between these two parts of the Moldavie have been restored despite the failure of the political negotiations.

Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Don't make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Don't make the site look like a graffiti site by painting or scratching graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, most of them understand it, and almost everyone can speak Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, because the law establishes that it is the first official language.
