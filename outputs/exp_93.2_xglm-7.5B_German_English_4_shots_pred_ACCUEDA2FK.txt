This confirms not only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also details which fossils do not provide, such as colour and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this bird were brown on the top and light- or carotenoid-coloured on the bottom.
The find also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not possess a well developed sheath called the quill, but other features of feathers possess – hooks and barbules – the researchers concluded that the quill must have been an earlier evolution than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or for heart function.
Researchers claimed that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows no feathers and is not a chicken.

The road, on which the accident took place, was temporarily closed while the rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was transferred to the Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was subsequently charged with murdering her son.
She is still in detention pending prosecution and trial, but eyewitness statements could be false as a result of widespread publicity.
This is the norm elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but the Scottish judiciary operates differently, and the courts have cited the publication of photographs as potentially harmful.
Professorin Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee comments: "Journalists seem to be crossing a dangerous line when they publish photographs or other material of suspects.
The Crown Office has hinted that no further comments will be made until the prosecution has commenced.
According to a leak, the document refers to the border dispute in which Palestinians demand a reversal of the borders in 1967.
Other issues that have been mentioned include the future of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel wants a military presence in the Jordan Valley for ten years from the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority wants a five-year presence only.
The hunters of the accompanying experiment should be closely supervised by rangers, as the experiment has been closely monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited for the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the director of Park Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the four selected hunters received comprehensive security and training training.
Martelly has just appointed a new Provisional Election Commission (CEP) with nine members.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP within four years.
Last month, a Presidential Commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of the package of measures to steer the country in the direction of new elections.
The Commission was the response of the regime to the widespread regime-critical protests that began in October.
The trigger for the violent protests was the failure to hold elections, some of which are due to be held in 2011.
Over 60 cases of overheating have been reported for defective iPods. In total six fires have been set and four people have suffered minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it had 27 accidents in connection with the devices.
Last week, the METI announced that it had received 34 additional reports of overheating from Apple, which it described as "not serious
The Ministry reacted by stating that the relocation of the report by Apple was'really regrettable'.
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday)
The office for civil protection in the northern Marianes said that no damage had been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center had also declared that there were no indications of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has kidnapped tourists from Hong Kong by taking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot with his M16 rifle at the tourists.
At least six hostages have been rescued and there are at least six confirmed deaths.
Six hostages, including the elderly and children, were released early on, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers took the place of an elderly lady when she had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in the footsteps of his father and chose a medical career.
He trained as a midwife and took up his work as a maternity doctor at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland
While he was working in the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature contractions.
His research showed that the application of a hormone accelerated the lung development of the fetus.
Xinhua reported that investigators from the government had recovered two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Ringer colleagues paid tribute to Luna as well.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of extremes. My first manager. Luna died in the night of the two moons. Very unique, exactly like she. A strong woman.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels gave the following comment: "Luna was as crazy as I was... maybe even crazier... I love her and I will miss her... hopefully she is in a better place.
Of the 1,400 people who were questioned in the run-up to the federal elections in 2010, the proportion of those who oppose Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent.
The temporary acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the election campaign for the federal election 2010, that she believed Australia would end its reign as the British monarchy should.
34 percent of the respondents agreed with this view and wanted that Elizabeth II. was the last Australian monarch.
29 per cent of those surveyed said Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 per cent said Australia should never become a republic.
The gold medal winner at the Olympic Games should swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three-person relay events, but because of his many complaints, his fitness was doubted.
He was not able to take the necessary medicines to alleviate his pain, because they are banned at the Commonwealth Games.
On 25 January 2008, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Many people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software on February 1 and on Tuesday it was announced.
Cosmic rays may have been a source of water supply for the Earth, together with organic matter which can form proteins and enable life.
These comets collided with the Earth long ago, and so scientists are hoping to gain insights into how planets, in particular the Earth, are formed.
Cuomo (53) took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He described the rumours as "political hot air" and "a bit of nonsense.
It is speculated that he may be running for the presidency in 2016.
NextGen is a system claimed by the FAA that would allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology rather than the older technology based on ground radar to enable the air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport facilities will be provided and the underground trains will not stop in Wembley. There are no parking or parking-and-ride facilities available on the ground.
With the fear of transport problems growing, the likelihood grew that the game would be played without the fans of the team.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the emergence of a new bird species on the ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and the Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species had developed within two generations, despite the fact that it had been previously thought to take much longer.
Gold can be processed into a variety of forms. It can be rolled into tiny pieces.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can be twisted and woven. It can be hammered or rolled into leaves.
It can be made so thin that it sometimes was used to decorate handwritten pictures, called calligraphy, in books called calligraphy books.
This is the pH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator with red apple juice.
The carbon dioxide changes its colour depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH level indicates the concentration of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemicals.
Hydrogen ions are protons which have been stripped of their electrons (because hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and
Mix the two powders together and then form them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a protective layer.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had almost every house equipped with a flush toilet, which was connected to a
Remains of wastewater systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia and China, there were toilets. In the Roman culture, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, which men and women visited in mixed company.
If you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back down to earth almost immediately.
The satellite was launched by a rocket into space. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and our view.
It is necessary to launch a huge rocket with a height of more than 100 feet to shoot a satellite into space or a telescope.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest service it has given us is much easier and faster transport.
It has brought us railways, cars and many other means of transport.
In them are cats of medium size, which eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-roaming domestic cats) that eat much smaller prey, such as insects, rodents, frogs and birds
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a special task that every cat has and that ensures that they do not compete with other cats.
Lions are the most social cats. They live in large groups, which are called 'packs'.
The herds are composed of one to three related adult males and up to three hundred females and young.
Women usually have a close relationship with each other, if they live in a large family with sisters and daughters.
Lions are like packs of wolves or dogs, animals that surprise the lion (but not other big cats) in their behaviour and are equally dangerous to their prey.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (although not particularly well), swim, long distance jump and with the fivefold power of a strong man pull.
The tiger is in the same family (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar." #
The roar of the tiger does not sound like the confident roar of the lion, but rather like a series of grumbling grumbling words.
Ocelot hunters eat small animals. If they can, they take monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than he is.
Scientists think that otters track prey with their sense of smell and find it by sniffing it.
You can see in the dark very well and move unseen. Ocelot hunters stalk their prey by matching their environment and then attacking.
If a small group of animals (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it comes (for example, if they move over a mountain or a river or if they move to a new island, so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so that the new population needs to have different characteristics or adaptations in order to be a strong competitor than what it used to need.
The original population has not changed at all. It still needs the same adaptations as before.
As time goes by, the new population adapts to its new environment, and then it looks increasingly like the other population to it.
In a few thousand or even millions of years, two populations will look so different that they will no longer be considered to be of the same species.
This process is called specialization, which simply means the emergence of new species.
Plants produce oxygen, which people breathe in, and they take carbon dioxide out, which people exhale.
Plants produce their food by photosynthesis. In addition, they provide shade.
We build our houses out of plants and make clothing out of plants. We eat mainly plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the largest predator of its time, so it feared nothing but other Mosasaurs.
His long jaws were equipped with more than 70 sharp teeth, including a second set on the tongue, which meant that there was no escape for any animal that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a stiff tongue. He ate fish, large fish, other Mosasaurs and was probably a cannibal.
He also took everything that came into the water; even a great dinosaur like the T. Rex was not big enough for him.
We know a large part of their food, but the Romans had their share of strange or unusual meals, including wild boar, peacock, snails and a kind of lizard called a seven-legged frog.
Another difference was that the poor people ate their food on chairs, while the rich men preferred to hold banquets where they sat on the side, while they ate their meals.
The Roman courts could not contain food that came from America or Asia in later centuries.
You had neither maize nor tomatoes nor potatoes nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman has ever eaten a turkey.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a temple which was regarded as the house of the god.
Man offered sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to comply with the wishes of the gods through rituals and festivals.
Every temple had a public temple and then an inner altar room, which only priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped temples, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses did not have such a great significance.
The greatest part of the life of the Hebrew family played itself out under the open sky.
The women cooked in the kitchen. There were simply open shop fronts on the street. For the house building, stone was used.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so that wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the old Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled for murder from Iceland. When he travelled further west, he found Greenland and gave it the name Greenland.
But, regardless of its discovery, the Eskimos lived there long before that.
Although all countries were Nordic, there were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the film "The Templer's Legacy", you may well think that on the reverse of the Declaration of Independence there was drawn a treasure map.
That is not true, although on the reverse of the document there is written something, it is not a treasure map.
The declaration of independence was written on the reverse side. The text is written on the top of the document.
Whether or not anyone knows who wrote it, it is known that the great scroll (which measures 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up at the beginning of its life to be stored.
It is therefore possible that the note simply was added as a label.
The landing on D-Day and the subsequent battles freed the North of France, but the South was still not free.
He was ruled by the 'Vichy' French, who had signed a peace treaty with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders, rather than fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies landed in southern France; the invasion was called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks the Americans and the French liberated the south of France and turned their attention to Germany.
A civilization is a distinct culture shared by a significant number of people who live together and work, a society.
The word civilisation comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin word civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city state and also somehow defines the size of a society.
Cities are the forerunners of nations. A civilised culture implies the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint and an appropriate dissemination.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving any significant historical evidence behind and fail to be recognised as genuine civilisations.
While the revolutionaries were fighting for independence, the 13 States formed a weak central government, consisting of the Congress.
The Congress was not empowered to tax, and there was no national executive or judicial authority, so it relied on the authorities of the states, who often did not cooperate.
He had no real authority to abolish taxes and duties between states.
The articles required unanimous agreement of all States before they could be amended, and the States took the Central Government so little seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
The most popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 motor racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in northern regions and Italians take part in international competitions and Olympic Games.
Japan has nearly 7000 islands (of which Honshu is the largest) which makes Japan the seventh largest island in the world.
Because of the cluster of islands, Japan is often referred to as an archipelago.
The beginning of Taiwan goes back to the 15th century, when European sailors passed through the island and recorded the name as Ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
1624 the Dutch East India Company establishes a branch in the southwest of Taiwan, which leads to a change in the cultivation methods of the indigenous people and employs Chinese workers on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan and declared it a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
The Qing dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), in which it renounced its sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island
Machu Picchu consists mainly of three buildings, namely the Intihuatana, the Sun Temple and the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex were rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they looked originally.
The restoration work on Machu Picchu has been carried out until 1976, and it continues to this day.
For example, 35 mm is the most widely used film format worldwide, which corresponds to the final film format of the analogue era.
It is still made, but it is more important that its image format has been taken over by digital camera sensor formats.
In fact, the 35-mm-format is confusingly 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve, to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore referred to as 3:2.
A wide range of common formats (the APS family, for example) have exactly the same or very similar aspect ratio.
The much-maligned and often mocked third rule is a simple directive that creates dynamism and at the same time preserves order in a picture.
It states that the intersection of the lines that divide a picture vertically and horizontally is the most effective place for the main motif (see example)." #
In this period of European history, the Catholic Church stood on the test.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has held together the European states despite different languages and customs.
His power was absolute, from the King to the common man.
One of the most important Christian beliefs states that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty.
The central authority of the church was in Rome for more than a thousand years. This concentration of power and money led many to doubt whether this principle had been upheld.
After the outbreak of hostilities in Germany, Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective, as it cut off vital military and civilian supplies from the country, despite this blockade violating the generally accepted international law that has been codified in several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain mined international waters in order to prevent vessels from penetrating whole oceanic areas, which was a danger for neutral ships as well.
The limited response to this tactic was that Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolation were the dominant attitudes of most citizens and countries.
After the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the nations wanted to avoid another such situation in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States in order to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the United States with only four cents in his pocket, with a book of poems and a recommendation letter from Charles Batchelor (his former boss) to Thomas Edison.
The old China had a unique way of showing different periods of time in China and each dynasty was a separate dynasty.
In the course of the dynastic periods there were also unstable periods of shared provinces. The most famous of these periods was the period of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and the Jin dynasties.
In these times, there were bitter wars among many nobles vying for the throne.
The time of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died in the struggle for the highest throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metrical system, a departure from absolutism towards republicanism and nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
In addition, all professions were open to all male applicants, so that the most ambitious and best succeeded.
The same applies to the military, because the rankings based on rank now are on the caliber.
The French Revolution inspired many oppressed people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed was very interested in things that went beyond the everyday life. He often visited a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Nur" (Light) to meditate.
The cave itself has survived the times and is a lively picture of Mohammed's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It is not easy to find, even if you know that it exists. Once you are in the cave, you are completely isolated.
You can see nothing but the clear, beautiful sky above and the numerous surrounding mountains. From the inside of the cave, very little of this world can be seen or heard.
The Cheops Pyramid is the only of the Seven Wonders of the World which still stands.
In the third century B.C. built by the Egyptians, the Cheops Pyramid is one of many great pyramids built to honour the dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau or the "Gizeh Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead comprises several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honour of the Pharaoh Cheops and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honour of his wives and family members.
The "spread" symbol looks like a V and the "stretch" symbol looks like a square, where the lower line is missing.
Up means that you start at the top and then move the arrow.
The erasing produces a softer sound, while the erasing is more robust and expressive.
You are free to add your own pencil marks; however, the printed lines are there for musical reasons, so they should be respected.
The terrified King Louis XIV, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two small children (Marie-Therese, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old) and the sister of the King, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris by a mob of market women on 6 October 1789.
They returned in a carriage back to Paris, surrounded by a mob of people who threatened the King and the Queen with violence.
The mob forced the King and Queen to open their windows.
Sometime later, a member of the angry mob turned his head in the direction of a royal guard killed in Versailles.
The expenditures of the American imperialists in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the U. S. to cover the bulk of the expenditures, and the interest on the bonds flowed through the banks of Wall Street in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the superprofits that originated from the continual exploitation of the Filipino people were the basic profits of the US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context in which they were founded.
The era in which the events took place is generally referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history that spanned the eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The high middle ages preceded the early middle ages, followed by the late middle ages, which ended in the same period.
Technological determinism is a concept that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technology push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that the human fate is determined by a fundamental logic which is linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
The interpretation of technological determinism is based on two general ideas. On the one hand, that the development of technology is a process that is largely beyond the influence of cultural or political factors, and on the other hand, that technology itself has effects on societies which are more intrinsic than socially determined.
You can say that the motor vehicle is a necessary development of roads.
However, a national road network for only a small number of cars is economically unsustainable. Therefore, new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The widespread ownership of cars also leads to an increased number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques in the health sector for repairing damaged bodies.
The Romanticism had a strong, cultural deterministic element, which was derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography formed individuals. Over time, customs and cultures developed with reference to this geography and these, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
So, as Paris is today known as the fashion capital of the world, so was Constantinople the fashion capital of the empire.
His fame as the epicentre of luxury began about 400 B.C. and lasted until about 1100 A. D.
His status fell in the course of the 12th century, partly because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices which were regarded as more valuable than the offerings of the Byzantine markets.
At this time, the title of the world's fashion capital was also transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th-11th and the 14th century.
At the beginning, the clothes were heavily influenced by the culture of Byzantium in the East.
However, the styles in the West are 25 to 30 years behind the rest of the world.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop a distinctive style. One of the most important developments of the time was the fact that people began to use buttons to fix their clothing.
Needs-based agriculture is agriculture that is designed to produce as many food products as possible so that the farmer or the farmer's family can meet their needs.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often biological cultivation, which uses saved, in the region's ecoregion native seeds and uses alternate cropping or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
In the past, most farmers were subsistence farmers and in many developing countries, that is still the case.
Subcultures bring together people who feel neglected by social norms, and enable them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be differentiated on the basis of age, ethnicity, class, place of residence and/or sex of members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as such can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual or geographical in nature or a combination of these factors.
Subcultures often signal their membership through a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits and jargon.
One of the most common ways of illustrating the importance of socialization is to rely on the few unfortunate cases of children who have not been socialized by adults because of neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse during their childhood.
Those children are called 'wild' or 'wild.' Some wild children were captured by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, neglect was due to the inability of the parents to accept the severe intellectual or physical limitations of the child.
Wolf cubs may have suffered severe child abuse or suffered traumatic experiences before they were abandoned or escaped.
Some have been reared by animals; others have lived alone in the wild.
If it has been raised entirely by animals, the wild child displays behaviours (in the context of his physical capabilities) which are almost entirely in accordance with those of his specific carer, such as his fear or indifference towards people.
While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support which helps individuals in a new learning situation, such as when they are using a new computer program or when they are starting a new project.
Fragwürdige Schattenberichterstatter haben es sich zur Aufgabe gemacht, die Formulare und den Anhang als das Gerüst des Vorschlags so einfach zu gestalten, dass sie von den Unternehmen mit möglichst geringem Verwaltungsaufwand ausgefüllt werden können.
Virtual assistance is built into the software and it is intended to question steps that the pupil may not be able to handle on his own, to suggest and explain.
Children are placed in a variety of foster homes, including for various reasons, which range from neglect to abuse to extortion.
No child should be forced to grow up in a environment that is not caring, loving and educationally oriented, but many are forced to do so.
The system of care is a piece of security for these children.
Our care homes system should provide a safe home, loving carers, a stable training and a reliable health care.
The foster home will cover all the needs that they had not been able to meet in the home from which they were previously removed.
The Internet connects both elements of mass communication, as well as interpersonal communication.
The specific features of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the benefit-cost approach.
For example, learning and socialisation are cited as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
(LT) Personal engagement and sustained relationships were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined the audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings led to important insights into the interpretation of microexpressions, short-lived facial movements.
In particular, it is claimed that one can tell whether someone is lying by deducing the slightest changes in facial expression.
In his article, Oliver Sacks showed how people with a brain injury can still correctly assess the honesty of people.
He even claimed that the ability to interpret human behaviour may be shared with animals such as dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation results in new genetic variations and selection removes these from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with each generation.
Out in the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of a human to meet his nutritional needs from available plant-based sources.
In addition, it has serious consequences if one does not take action: depression, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The easiest to access plant resources would have been proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for us, unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal sources (insects, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest but also provide large quantities of proteins which contain all essential amino acids.
In general, it should not surprise us if our forefathers solved their "protein problem" in the same way as chimpanzees in the savanna today.
Sleep compensation is the process of targeted awakening during normal sleep periods and the subsequent short sleep (10-60 minutes) later.
This can be achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without completely waking you up.
If you are someone who imagines the alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room so that you have to leave the bed to turn it off.
Another way of looking at it is to drink a lot of fluids before going to bed (especially water or tea, which is known for its urinary-tonic effect), so that you have to get up to go to the toilet.
The degree of inner calm that a person has is correlated inversely with the degree of tension in the body and the mind.
The lower the tension is, the more positive the existing life force. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can attain enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded to include the path of love of the Mahayana and numerous techniques of the Indian yoga.
In principle, the Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (Knowledge energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The centre of tibetan meditation is the goddess yoga. By visualizing various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are opened and the enlightened consciousness is born.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war, the collision of systems, the course and the culture, led to the fact that the countries fought each other.
Two years after the end of the War, the former Allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
He should last for the next 40 years and be carried out in the real world by proxy armies on battlefields in Africa, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defence was already completely broken down and the only hope lay in a retreat and a reorganisation along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans were, however, almost overnight obsolete, when over 800,000 Soviet soldiers invaded the white Russian and Ukrainian fronts and created, after they invaded the violation of the Riga Pact, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements into the eastern regions of Poland.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is the most efficient method of transporting large human and goods volumes over the seas.
The task of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that a country is able to carry people and goods and at the same time to hinder the enemy's ability to carry people and goods.
One of the most significant recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign during the Second World War. The Americans tried to bring workers and material across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time the German Navy tried to stop this traffic mainly with submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Britain exactly as the rest of Europe.
It is thought that goats were domesticated in the Zagros Mountains in Iran some 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and peoples began to keep them as livestock to get easily at their milk, fur, meat and skin.
House goats were usually kept in herds that wandered about on hills or other pasture areas. They were cared for by goat herders, just like the more familiar sheep herders; often, it was children or adolescents. These pasture systems
In the nineteenth century, England built railways.
Because the railway tracks were made up of parallel wooden planks, the horses could reach higher speeds and carry heavier loads than on the rougher roads of the time.
As early as the 19th century, railways were introduced to ensure the position of the rails. Gradually, however, it became apparent that railways carrying a railway track were more efficient.
This was customary, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the cart.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. 1767 were the first fully iron railway tracks introduced.
The first known means of locomotion was walking. The first human to walk was the Homo erectus, which means "standing man".
Your predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not go so regularly.
Two-footed species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4,2 to 3,9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can live more sustainably, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate future suffering a little.
This is in many cases merely a symptomatic treatment. If you are not only seeking temporary solutions, then we should look at the root of the problem and treat it.
It is plainly obvious that the world has changed due to the scientific and technological advances of mankind and that the problems have become more serious due to overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles of the people.
After its passage by the US Congress on 4 July, a handwritten draft, signed by the Congress President John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to the printers of John Dunlap.
In the course of the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are known as "Dunlap broadsides" today.
The first reading of the document took place on 8 July in the Independence Hall in Philadelphia.
A petition was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
There are still 25 Dunlap broadsides in existence. The original handwriting has not survived the times.
Many paleontologists now believe that there is a group of dinosaurs that survived and are still alive. They are called birds.
Many people see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But many things in birds still look like dinosaurs.
You have feet with scales and claws, you lay eggs and run on both hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the processing of information in binary form.
A binary number can only have one of two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.
It is not possible to diagnose an internal poisoning straight away. The symptoms, for example vomiting, are so general that one cannot make a diagnosis straight away.
The best sign of a poisoning by ingestion is the presence of an open container of medicines or household chemicals.
Look for instructions for specific first aid for this particular poison.
The term ‘waste’ is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this insect group.
This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs. These are insects that are very adaptable to parasitizing humans.
So both bed bugs and fleas are nidicolous, meaning that they live in their nests or in the homes of their hosts.
In the United States there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which is the most common neurological disease among adults aged between 20 and 40 years.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and the peripheral nerves.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
A couple can decide that it is not in their own interest or in the interest of their child to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to adopt a plan for their baby.
When a child is adopted, the biological parents give up their parental rights, so that another couple can take over the parental responsibilities.
The main aim of science is to discover how the world works. This method is in fact the basis of most scientific investigations.
It is not only about experimentation, where an experiment is a test to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also guided by the setting of questions and the observation of events.
Natural scientists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts and in particular on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were accepted.
With the loss of Greek language skills, Western Europe was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behaviour are often borne of the presence of body-specific cycles and their production by biological clocks.
A cycle of behaviours that are not only responses to external cycles, but also known in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that even in absence of external signals continue to oscillate in free-swinging cycles.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the most important evidences that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacteria.
They took two experiments, one in which they either labelled the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphor or a protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the genetic material concerned and whether it is a germline cell.
Mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cancer or death.
Naturalist tourism draws people who are interested in visiting nature reserves, to enjoy the landscape, including wild flora and fauna.
Exemplary activities are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
Another example is the visit, photography and study of orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave small provincial towns with their cars, to their workplace, and are passed by others whose workplace is the place they just left.
In this dynamic transport pendulum, all are in some way connected to a transport system based on private cars, and support it.
Science now points out that this massive carbon economy has brought the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has supported the human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone takes part in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, you will rarely hear complaints about the water quality or the collapse of bridges as much as you will hear about the quality of the air.
Why do transport systems fail so often? Why are transport engineers incompetent? Or is there something fundamentally wrong here?
Traffic flow is the investigation of individual drivers and vehicles moving between two points and the interactions between these two points.
It is very difficult to study traffic flows, because one cannot predict the behaviour of drivers with certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave reasonably consistently; therefore, traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be mathematically expressed in a rough way.
To better represent the flow of traffic, the relationships between the three main characteristics have been defined: (1) River, (2) Density and (3) Speed.
These links will help in the planning, design and operation of facilities on the road.
The first animals to conquer the sky were insects. Their ability to fly helped them to evade enemies more easily and find more efficient food and mates.
Most insects can fold their wings along their bodies.
As a result, they have a wider choice of small caves in which they can hide from predators.
Today, butterflies and moths are the only insects that can fly without folding their wings.
A man named Aristarch claimed that the sun was the centre of the movements of the solar system.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed that the solar system including the sun and even the other stars were moving around the earth.
It seems reasonable, because it doesn't seem to move the Earth, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest and the most water-rich river in the world. It flows more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, with a width of up to six miles.
20 percent of the water that flows over rivers on the planet flows into the oceans from the Amazon.
The Amazon basin main river is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It takes water from thousands of smaller rivers into it.
Although the building of pyramids continued up to the end of the Old Kingdom, the Pyramids of Gizeh never surpassed their size and the technical perfection of their construction.
Egyptians in the ancient New Kingdom marvelled at the monuments of their forefathers, which were thousands of years old.
The Vatican City has a population of around 800. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language of most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known to mankind for thousands of years, since they can be found in their original form in nature and are easily extracted with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, posited the theory that all things are made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements.
This corresponded more to the four states of aggregation (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma. He also posited the theory that they would transform into new substances to form what we see.
League is a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are regarded as metals. Of course, there are also other metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys which contain small quantities of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
The universe is made up of matter in its entirety. All matter consists of tiny particles, atoms.
Atoms are so small that billions of them would fit in the end of this sentence.
As a result, the pencil was invented by many people to be a good friend to many people.
It is sad to say that the pencil has been pushed back into the background by the introduction of new writing methods, so that it has lost its status and its use." #
Today, people write messages on computer screens, without ever having to come close to a flare gun.
We should be very curious to see what the keyboard will look like when something newer comes along.
The atomic bomb is based on the principle that energy is needed to combine a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like if you were to roll a heavy car up a hill. If the core is split, some of this energy will be released.
Some atoms have unstable cores, which means that they will break down even at the slightest shock.
The surface of the moon consists of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is referred to as the crust.
The outer shell is about 70 km thick on the near side and about 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the mare and thicker under the highland.
On the near side, there could be more Maria, since the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Theoretical theories focus on finding what people are interested in or concerned about.
The theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are inculcated during their adulthood.
These theories deal with the reasons why certain people want to do exactly what they do, and what influences in their environment cause them to do or not to do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
There are two possible behaviours when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the boys" (or of the girls).
This kind of manager has problems making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary measures, issuing performance appraisals, assigning responsibility and enforcing discipline.
At the other end of the spectrum one becomes a non-recognisable individual who has to change everything as the team has done and takes everything for itself.
Lastly, the team leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behaviour often leads to friction between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are led by the same high standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams can meet in different time zones which may not be taken into account by the local management.
The presence of a truly invisible team (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also an unique feature of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the leadership team, to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organisation undertake the time-consuming process of introducing an organisational learning concept? A goal for the practical implementation of organisational learning concepts is innovation.
If all the available resources are effectively used by all the departments of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can arise.
In the end, the work of the Community can lead to the overcoming of a hindrance to a new innovative procedure in which to respond to customer needs.
Before an organisation can be innovative, the leadership must develop a culture of innovation and shared knowledge and learning.
Angel (2006) explains the concept of the Continuum as a method to help organisations become more effective.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognitive abilities. This limits the research field and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research.
It is well known that various types of brain damage, such as trauma, injuries and tumours, influence the behaviour and cause changes in some brain functions.
New technologies allow us to see certain brain structures and processes for the first time and to study them.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that will help us understand the processes in our heads.
KI is not only associated with science fiction, but is also a very important branch of computer science which deals with behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence includes the production of machines that require intelligent behaviour.
These are just a few examples of the many ways in which the EU is working to improve the quality of life for its citizens.
Things like these have become separate disciplines, which are focused on finding solutions for the real world problems.
The KI system is now being used in many areas of industry, medicine, engineering and military and is also being incorporated into numerous software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of every school. Often a teacher would like to take her students to places where a bus journey is not possible.
Virtual tours are a technical solution. The students can view museum objects from their classrooms, visit aquariums or admire beautiful works of art.
A virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design each year a website about their trip to the capital of the state. The website is updated each year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a collection album.
Blogs can also help improve the writing skills of students. Although students at the beginning of their blog experience often have a sloppy grammar and spelling, this usually changes as a result of a readership.
Students are often very critical audiences, so the blogger makes an effort to improve his writing style to avoid criticism.
The blogging forces students to learn more about the world around them. The need to attract the attention of the audience inspires students to write intelligently and interestingly (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to continue learning outside the traditional school day.
The use of blogs can help students to become more analytical and critical; by responding to Internet material students can define their own positions in the context of texts of others and present their own perspectives on particular topics.
Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital of Canada and is home to a number of art galleries and museums that present Canada's past and present.
In the South are the Niagara Falls, and in the North, the untouched beauty of nature spreads out in Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and other things make Ontario unique as what is regarded by outsiders as typical of Canada.
A large area further north is pretty sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that many surprises: there are more African Americans in the US than Canadian citizens.
The Indian Ocean islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, in terms of animal life, a separate continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or belonging to France and are known as luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to the islands, and in the Comoros and Mayotte it was very successful.
The European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
Northernly, the region is bounded by the Sahel zone and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all women travelling should declare themselves married, irrespective of their actual marital status.
Also, wearing a ring is helpful (don't wear a ring that looks too expensive.")
Women should recognise that cultural differences can lead to what they regard as a violation and that it is not uncommon to be followed, handcuffed, etc.
Keep your position firm, if you reject men, and do not be afraid to defend it (cultural differences, or whatever; that does not mean that it is okay!)
The present Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the tenth century before the beginning of time, and was used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Merinides as a strategic port with the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed them and rebuilt them under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon them after a earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan built the city as Dar el Beida again and it was called Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
It is easy to find places in the old Medina where traditional Moroccan goods such as Tagines, pottery, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of tinned food are sold, but that is all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the extreme east near Rwanda.
In 2002, the Nyiragongo Volcano erupted, destroying most of the roads in the city, especially the city centre.
While Goma is relatively safe, every stay outside Goma should be carefully planned to learn about the situation in the province of North Kivu.
The town is also the starting point for the ascent of the Nyiragongo volcano and for some of the cheapest gorilla tracking tours in Africa.
You can use Bodabodas (motorbike taxis) to get around Goma. The usual fare is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short ride.
This in combination with its relative remoteness has made "Timbuktu" a metaphor for exotic, far-off countries.
Although Timbuktu is a tourist attraction and has a airport, it is today a poor city.
In 1990 it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites due to the threat of sandstorms.
It was one of the most important stops on Louis Gates' PBS special "Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the cities of the country, because it has a rather Arab than an African ambiance.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa. It borders in the east with Mozambique, in the north with Zimbabwe and in
The park has an area of 19.500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecosystems, each of which supports a different animal world.
He is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is regarded as the symbol of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As all South African National Parks, the Park charges daily entry fees.
It can also be worthwhile to buy a wild card that allows you to enter either selected parks in South Africa or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the namesake of the territory of Hong Kong and is the focus of many tourists.
The buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline were compared with a shimmering bar chart that was visible through the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best prospects for Hong Kong, you should leave the island and head for the opposite shore of Kowloon.
The majority of the city formation of Hong Kong Island is concentrated along the newly acquired land along the north coast.
This is the place that the British colonists have taken over. If you look for traces of colonial history in the area, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forest in the world and extend over 80 km from the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland to the coast.
The Sundarbans were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The area within the Indian territory is referred to as Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not only mangrove swamps - they also encompass some of the last remaining remnants of the mighty forest that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which 3,200 km2 is water and marshland.
The Sundarbans are a nature reserve since 1966 and estimates indicate that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer there.
Buses run all day long from the district-wide bus station (on the other side of the river) and most of the buses, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30 in
Buses are often full, so it is advisable to buy a ticket in advance.
Most districts are by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
Taxi-hailing services offer a fast and convenient way to get to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock Bridge is a curved cable bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Your two towers are 83 metres high, their length is 378 metres and they have two lanes with 3,50 m width.
The bridge's height is 15 meters. The construction work was completed in August 2011, but the opening of the bridge was delayed until March 2017.
The bridge will be fully operational by September 2017. It is expected that the Brazilian customs checkpoints will then be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group that lived in the present-day Paraguayan Oeste. They were seminomadic hunters who also practised
The Chaco region was also home to other indigenous groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing
Paraguay, formerly the Great Province West Indies, was formed in the 16th century as a result of the encounter of the Spanish conquistadors with the i
The Spanish began colonisation, which lasted for three centuries.
Asunción was able to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity since 1537.
Argentina is well known for its polo team and its players being among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at Las Cañitas Polo fields.
Small tournaments and competitions can also be looked at at other times of the year.
Informations on competitions and polo ticket outlets can be found at the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is set in accordance with the value of the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged in the only bank on the island that is located opposite the FIC West Store.
The pound is generally accepted everywhere in the United Kingdom and at Stanley credit cards. Also, US dollars are often accepted.
On the remote islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, but British and American currency can be accepted; ask the owners in advance which payment method is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange the currency of the Falkland Islands outside the islands themselves, so you should exchange your money before you leave the island.
In Montevideo, which is south of the equator, it is summer when it is winter in the northern hemisphere.
Montevideo is in the tropics. In summer, temperatures can reach over 30°C.
Winter can be misleadingly cold: the temperatures rarely go below freezing point, but wind and moisture lead to that it feels colder than what the thermometer shows.
There are no distinctly wet or dry seasons: The amount of rainfall remains over the whole year in about the same.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to the sight of people, they are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the instructions of the park authorities, visitors should keep at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals.
Even if Bisons, Wapitis, Elches, Bears and all the big animals behave peacefully, it can still happen that they turn on each other.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured, because they do not take enough space. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them enough space.
Be aware that odours attract bears and other wildlife. Avoid carrying strong smelling foods or cooking them and ensure that your camp is clean.
Apia is the capital of the island of Upolu and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 18th century and is now the official capital of Samoa.
The port was the scene of a shameful stalemate in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships except one British warship were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans died.
While the Mau Movement was organising the independence struggle, a peaceful assembly in the town killed the chief of the Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Auckland is spread over two harbours, so there are many beaches. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the district of North Harbour) lie on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Most of the beaches are sandy with safe swimming areas and most offer shade, which is provided by the Pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located at the harbour of Waitemata, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
There are family beaches, which are sometimes overcrowded, with a beautiful promenade along the coast. Swimming is safe here.
The most important local beer is "Number One". It is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is "Manta".
There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines are probably better tolerated.
Local tap water can be safely drunk, but if you are concerned, you will also find bottled water.
For Australians, the idea of coffee ""flat white"" is foreign. A small black is ""espresso"" and a cappuccino is ""double shot"" with foam, and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is Belgian standard. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many trips to the reef take place all year round and any injury caused by any of these causes on the reef is rare.
However, you should follow the Council of Administrations, pay attention to the warnings and especially pay attention to security warnings.
Shellfish are common in the vicinity of beaches and in the vicinity of river mouths from October to April north of 1770.
Haies exist, but they rarely attack people. Most of them are afraid of people and would flee.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live in the sea, their primary habitat is in river mouths north of Rockhampton.
A reservation ahead of time gives the traveller the assurance that he will have a place to stay when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although you may also book other accommodation, such as camping, through a travel agent.
Travel agencies usually offer packages in which breakfast, transport to and from the airport or even a combination of flight and hotel are included.
You can also hold your reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain further documents for your destination (for example, visas).
Any changes or requests should however first be addressed to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
Many festivals are decided by a large majority of festival-goers to camp out, and most visitors find this to be an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you have to get there early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that there will be music playing on parts of the festival until late at night, even though the music on the main stages has stopped.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin condition, as the breaking of ice can be quite disturbing for the most affected.
Cruise ships also offer time for a stay in the city. Passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos generally try to keep their guests as long as possible and to spend as much money as possible. There are no windows or clocks and exits are sometimes difficult to find.
You normally have a special offer of food, beverages and entertainment to keep the guests entertained and to ensure that they stay.
Some casinos offer alcoholic beverages free of charge. However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good players know how important it is to remain sober." #
Those who want to drive over high mountains or over passes should be prepared for snow, ice and temperatures below freezing.
On icy and snowy roads, the liability is low and you can't drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
In very short time one can accumulate so much snow that one can come to a standstill.
The visibility can also be impaired by falling or drifting snow or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, cold and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic continues to run throughout the year largely uninterrupted.
Safaris are probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term'safari' is used in everyday language to describe a trip to Africa to see the overwhelming wildlife there, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars close, and the standard equipment enables good visibility.
Lions, leopards and cheetahs are often shy and you can observe them better with a telescope.
A bushwalk is a walk that lasts for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will take place in other locations in all of Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Olympic Summer Games after it already hosted the 1964 Games.
If you have already booked your flights and accommodation for 2020, before the rescheduling was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
The cancellation rules vary, but from March onwards most cancellation rules did not apply until July 2020, for the Olympic Games that were planned.
It is estimated that most tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, a typical ticket will cost around ¥7,000.
Brushing wet clothes can help dry them. Many hotels provide irons and ironing boards, even if you are not present in the room.
If no iron is available or you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can try to use a hairdryer if one is available.
Don't overheat the fabric (it can shrink it or in extreme cases lead to burns).
There are various methods for cleaning water. Some of them are more effective than others in dealing with certain dangers.
In some areas it is enough to boil water for a minute, in others it is necessary to boil it for several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you have any concerns, then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers can encounter animal pests they do not know from their home regions.
Invasive species can destroy food crops, cause irritation or even cause allergic reactions, poison or transmit disease.
Infections as such or dangerous animals that can wound or kill people are usually not regarded as vermin.
Free shopping is the possibility to buy goods which are exempt from taxes and duties at certain places.
Travellers who have a destination country with a high tax rate can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, particularly on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmount on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway is the most challenging driving section, as it often leads through remote, undeveloped terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: steep gradients, narrow roads and sharp turns are prevalent here.
The speed limits indicated are considerably lower than in the previous and following sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and their strict enforcement is even more important than usual.
But interestingly, the mobile coverage here is much better than in many other sectors of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German bread is very tasty. In Bavaria, it is very rich and varied, as well as in Austria.
Sweetbread is widespread, with apples being cooked all year round and plums and cherries being used in summer.
Many German cakes also contain hazelnuts, walnuts or other nuts. Popular cakes often fit particularly well to a cup of strong coffee.
If you want to produce small, but tasty breads, then try this, which is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen in different regions.
A curry is a dish that is based on herbs and spices, with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either dry or wet.
In the interior of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is usually used in curries; in South India and in some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is
With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a catch-all term that encompasses a great diversity of regional cuisines that can be found throughout the country
When the term is used without any further attributes, it usually refers to the food that originates from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine, which is now widely spread throughout the island, offers a variety of simple spiced dishes. As taste-enhancing agents, the Javans prefer nuts, chilis, sugar (especially javan coconut sugar) and a number of aromatic spices
Stitching is the aids for the horses' legs which hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They give the horse more stability, but there are safety concerns because the feet of the horse may get caught in them.
If a rider falls off the horse and hooks his foot on the stirrup, he can be pulled along if the horse passes. To minimise this risk, a number of precautions can be taken.
First of all, the riders wear shoes with a flat sole and a smooth, narrow heel.
In addition, some saddles, in particular English saddles, have safety buckles which allow a saddle to fall off when it is pulled off by a falling rider.
The Cochamó Valley – Chile’s most important climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a number of large granite walls and -cliffs.
The summits offer a spectacular view. Climbers from all over the world discover new routes along the walls, which offer endless possibilities.
Departure sports such as skiing and snowboarding are popular sports, in which you attach skis or a snowboard to your feet and descend a slope over a snow covered surface." #
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as'ski-penners', who plan their entire holiday around skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depicting skiers go back to 5000 BC!
The origins of skiing as a sport go back at least to the 17th century and in 1861 the first ski club in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Skitouring with backpack: This activity is also known as ski touring or ski walking.
It resembles alpine skiing or mountaineering, but it does not necessarily include it as it requires a lot of firm skis and boots.
You also regard the ski route as a comparable hiking route.
If you are in good physical condition you can walk longer distances than you can on a hiking trail – only very rarely will you reach the speed of a skiing run without a heavy pack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries. Normally, one would have to apply for multiple visas and go through multiple passport controls if one wanted to travel through several countries.
The Schengen area works in this respect, however, somewhat like a country.
So long as you remain in this zone, you can usually cross the border without having to go through the passport control again.
According to the Schengen visa rules, you do not have to apply for a visa for each of the Schengen Member States individually, which saves time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universally accepted definition of what is an antique. Some tax authorities define over 100 years old goods as antiquities.
The definition is geographically different, with a lower age limit in areas like North America.
Hand-made products could be described as 'antique', although they are younger than similar products produced in mass production.
The reindeer breeding industry is a major source of livelihood for the Sámi, and the culture around the trade is also important for many who work in other professions.
In the past, not all Sámi have bred large herds of reindeer, but have lived off agriculture, hunting and fishing.
Today, many Sámi work in modern professions. Tourism is a major source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
In addition, the term ""Gypsies"" is often used by non-Roma as a pejorative term, since it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma.
If you are visiting a country that has issued you a travel warning, your travel insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also consult the advice of other governments as your own. Their advice is however tailored to their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may be confronted with situations that are different from those faced by Europeans or Arabs.
Conferences are only a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views expressed are often superficial, general and in comparison to the more detailed information found elsewhere are too simplistic.
Weather is the umbrella term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, social disruption or loss of life.
Floods can occur anywhere in the world and there are various types of them, which depend on geography, topography and the atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall and forest fires are forms and effects of storms, as are thunderstorms, tornados,
Regional and seasonal weather phenomena are among others blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
Travellers are urged to be on the lookout for any type of weather that affects their area, as this may affect all their travel plans.
Everyone planning to travel to a country that is considered a war zone should have a professional training in order to avoid being caught up in the conflict.
A search for ""course on hostile environments"" will probably bring up the address of a local firm.
A course covers the issues discussed in this forum in a much more detailed way, usually combined with practical experience.
A course is usually between 2 and 5 days long and includes role-playing, much first aid and sometimes weapons training.
There are many books and journals on survival in the wilderness, but very few publications on war-torn areas.
Travellers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure that they have valid travel documents for their return.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with a non-specified gender (X) or documents that have been updated to the desired name and gender is different.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognise these documents is also very different.
The searches at security checks have become far more intrusive in the aftermath of 11 September 2001.
Transgender people should not expect that their privacy and dignity will be respected when they pass through the scanners.
Riss currents are the return current of broken waves, often at reefs or similar.
Because of the underwater topography, the return flow concentrates in a few deeper areas and a rapid current can form there.
Most deaths occur by exhaustion trying to swim against the current, which is impossible.
When you get out of the current, it is not difficult to get back in.
If you are trying to get somewhere, where you are not going to be caught again, try to get somewhere where you are not going to be caught again. Alternatively, if you have been noticed, perhaps
The shock of return is earlier than the shock of culture shock (the honeymoon phase is not as pronounced), lasts longer and is more serious.
Travellers who were able to adapt to the new culture were often particularly hard-pressed to adapt to their own culture.
When one returns from an overseas trip, one has adapted to a different culture and has abandoned some of the customs of his home culture.
When you first travelled abroad, people probably were patient and understanding because they knew that travellers had to adapt to a new country.
Man might expect not to be able to show patience and understanding to Europeans returning from foreign trips.
The sound and light show at the Pyramids is one of the most interesting attractions for children in the area.
You can see the Pyramids in the dark and while it is still quiet before the show begins.
Normally, you hear the sounds of tourists and shopkeepers. The history of noise and light is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is used as a backdrop and narrator of a long history.
The scenes are being shown on the pyramids, with the different pyramids being illuminated.
The Southern Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most stations. In 2020, there were sixteen active.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the Kola Peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
More islands are Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbour.
Elsworthland is the region south of the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula rise up here and then split off again to form the 360 km long chain of Ellsworth Mountains, which is divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak is the Mount Vinson with 4892 m height.
In remote areas without mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone can be the only option.
A satellite phone is not a substitute for a mobile phone, because you have to be in clear sight of a satellite, in order to make a call.
The service is often used by ships, including pleasure ships, and expeditions that require data and voice links.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information about the connection to this service.
An ever more popular option for those planning to take a year off work are study and course opportunities abroad.
This is particularly popular among university graduates, since it allows them to take a year off without affecting their studies.
In many cases, participation in an exchange programme can actually improve your chances of getting a university education in your home country.
In most cases, a fee is charged for applying for these programmes.
Finland is a great destination for boat tours. The "land of thousands of lakes" has also thousands of islands - in the lakes and in the archipelagoes." #
For the archipelagos and lakes, you don't need a yacht.
In addition, even though the coastal island groups and the largest lakes are in fact large enough for every boat, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is the national pastime in Finland, one in six or eight people own a boat.
This is not comparable to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (in the Netherlands, the ratio is one to fourty.)
Most Eastbound cruises include a longer stay in St. Petersburg in Russia.
That means that you can visit the historic city for several whole days, while you return at night and stay on the ship.
If you only go on a tour of the countryside, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
A few cruises offer Berlin as a destination in their brochures. You can see on the map above that Berlin is far from the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of a cruise.
Travelling by air can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and from all walks of life, especially if they have never travelled or had a traumatic experience.
It is not shameful: It is nothing but the personal fears and prejudices that many people have.
More information about the operation of aircraft and the processes that take place during a flight can help many to overcome their fear of the unknown or the feeling of being powerless.
Courier companies are paid well for the fast delivery of things. Often, time is an extremely important factor in documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the larger companies use their own aircraft, but on other routes and at smaller companies, difficulties arose.
If they shipped things via air freight, the loading and customs clearance could take several days on some routes.
The only way to get it done quicker was to send it as a baggage." The airline regulations do not allow you to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly in first or business class is to pay a hefty sum to get the privilege.
That is, however, not cheap: As a rough guide, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business and first class for the first class.
It is pointless to look for discounts on direct flights from A to B, even if you are looking for business or first class seats.
The airlines know very well that there is a certain core group of passengers who are prepared to pay a lot of money to be able to get to their destination quickly and easily and they demand appropriate prices.
The capital of Moldova is Kishinev. The native language is Romanian, but many people speak Russian as well.
Moldova is a multiethnic state which has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
The 1994 conflict led to the formation of the self-appointed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognised by any UN member state.
While the political negotiations failed, the economic relations between these two parts of the Republic of Moldavia were restored.
The most important religion in Moldova is the Christian Orthodox.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transport hub.
The once ancient city of Smyrna is today a modern, progressive and prosperous business centre located at a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass buildings and modern shopping centres are shaped by classic red tiled roofs, the market from the 18th century, as well as old mosques and churches, although the city is more characterised by a Mediterranean atmosphere than that of traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
There are also some interesting marble sculptures of birds on the cemetery.
It is worth a half hour to wander through the fascinating village.
In the north and close to it is the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which has become known to foreigners after Lord Byron described its beauty in vivid colours.
The Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly over Cabo da Roca to Sintra.
Visit also in the north the great shrine of Our Lady of the Rosary of Fatima (pilgrimage centre) – a place that is world famous for its Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are actually visiting a mass grave and a place of immense significance for a substantial part of the world population.
There are still many men and women who have survived here, and many more who have survived with their relatives who were murdered or died working, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat this site with the dignity, respect and honour it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Don't vandalise the place by painting or scratching it.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer Catalan, the majority understand it, and so many can speak Spanish.
Most of the signs are, however, only in Catalan, since it is legally set as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely spoken in public transport and other public places.
Normal announcements are made in the metro exclusively in Catalan, but unforeseen faults are reported by an automated system in a variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are said to be arrogant, self-centred and rude.
It is a common misconception that Parisians are the best behaved people in the world, but it is true that you will find yourself in Paris much better if you show yourself as someone who is well-bred.
The rough exterior of Paris disappears quickly if you put basic manners to work.
The Plitwitzer Seen National Park is heavily wooded, with mainly oak, fir and pine trees and it offers a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
He has a remarkable diversity of microclimates, different soils and different altitudes.
The area is also home to a very large diversity of animal and bird species.
There are rare fauna such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, foxes, wild cats and chickens, as well as many more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts that reach to the knees and cover their shoulders.
In most monasteries there are no dresses for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one in bright colours, the monk or nun at the gate will smile at you.
In analogy, men should wear trousers that reach above the knees.
Also, these can be borrowed from the stock, but the clothes will not be washed after every user, so you may not feel comfortable in these shirts." For men there is a uniform size!
The mallorcan cuisine is based, as in similar regions of the Mediterranean, on bread, vegetables and meat (particularly pork) and uses olive oil.
A simple, popular evening meal is the Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any available ingredient such as cheese, tuna etc.
All nouns begin with a capital letter in the middle of a sentence, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is a very important way of distinguishing between some verbs and objects.
It makes reading easier, but writing is a little difficult because you have to determine whether a word is a preposition or a noun.
The Italian pronunciation is relatively easy, since most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to be aware of are c and g, since their pronunciation varies depending on the vowel following them.
Also, look at the difference between r and rr: caro means ""love"" and carro means ""carriage"" or ""wagon"".
The Persian language has a relatively simple and, for the most part, regular grammar.
Because of this introduction to Persian grammar, you will be able to learn more about Persian grammar and understand better the wordings.
If you speak a Romance language, it is much easier to learn Portuguese.
People who speak Spanish could, however, be quick to conclude that Portuguese is so similar that it is not necessary to learn it separately.
Ancient observatories are no longer in operation and are now museums or educational centres.
As the light pollution during its peak was not the problem it is today, they are usually found in cities or on university grounds that are easier to reach than the newer buildings erected in recent times.
Most modern astronomical observatories are colossal structures in remote areas with favourable atmospheric conditions.
The viewing of the cherry blossoms, known as hanami, is a part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept comes from China, where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first Cherry Blossom Festivals were held by the Emperor for himself and other members of the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove just one.
If you visit a formally laid out garden and collect samples, you will also be thrown out without discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to live in and once you arrive you can almost buy everything.
You are located in the extremes of the tropics and only a few degrees north of the equator, so you have to deal with both heat (always) and strong sun (rarely).
There are also a few buses that go northwards to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives
Please ensure that the bus you are travelling in will take you to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kirjat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good basis for planning your holiday.
For example, visits to castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or a cruise along the Erie Canal.
They are also popular walking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is seen as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions around the festival were also adopted by non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries.
There is a tradition to spend the night of Easter openly, to see the sunrise.
There are certainly Christian-theological explanations for this tradition, but it could also be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
Traditional churches often hold a midnight vigil on Easter Sunday, when the celebrations of the community begin at midnight, when the resurrection of Christ is celebrated.
All animals that arrived on the islands originally came either by swimming, flying or by being swept here.
Because of the great distance from the continent, mammals were not able to undertake the journey, which made the giant tortoise the main grazing animal on the Galapagos Islands." #
From the first people to visit the Galapagos Islands, many animals have been introduced, including sheep, horses, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise over the horizon.
This provides an excellent opportunity to see the Northern Lights, since the sky is darker or lighter depending on the time of day.
The sparsely-populated areas and the light pollution are often not a problem, so you can enjoy the starry sky.
The Japanese work culture is hierarchical and formal than what Westerners might be used to.
Grey suits are the usual business attire and colleagues address each other by their family names or by their occupational titles.
The harmony at work is of paramount importance, with the focus more on the group effort than on individual achievement.
Often, employees have to obtain the consent of their superiors in order to make decisions that they take, and it is expected of them that they follow the instructions of their bosses without question.
