This confirms not only that some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides details that fossils do not provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the fur of this animal was on the top of the head brown and on the bottom of the head light- or carotinoid-coloured.
The find also gives us an insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well developed sheath called the quill, but other features of feathers – hooks and barbules – the researchers concluded that the quill probably was an evolutionary development later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or for heartbeat.
The scientists claimed that this is the tail of a young dinosaur, but the sample showed no feathers.

The candidates may send representatives to witness the whole process. At night, the votes will be counted by volunteers under strict supervision and in accordance with special procedures.

She is in custody until the prosecution and trial, but eyewitness statements could be false, as her image has been widely published.
This is a practice elsewhere in the UK, but the courts in Scotland work differently, and the judges have considered the publication of photos as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes: "Journalists seem to be crossing a dangerous line when they publish photographs or other material of suspects.
The Crown Office, which is responsible for prosecuting, has indicated to journalists that at least until the prosecution has been brought no further comments will be made.
According to a leak, the document refers to the border dispute, in which the Palestinians demand a reversal of the borders in the state of 1967 prior to the Six
Other topics that are supposedly covered include the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel wants a military presence in the Jordan Valley for 10 years from the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority wants a five-year presence only.
The shooters of the accompanying experiment to control the plague should be closely supervised by rangers, as the experiment has been monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited to assist with the NPWS's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the director of Park Conservation and Heritage at the NPWS, the four selected hunters received comprehensive security and training.
Martelly has just appointed a new provisional electoral commission (CEP) with nine members.
It is his fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a Presidential Commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of the package of measures to steer the country in the direction of new elections.
The Commission was the response to the widespread regime-critical protests that began in October.
The trigger for the sometimes violent protests was the failure to hold elections, some of which are due to be held in 2011.
Over 60 cases of overheating have been reported for defective iPods. In total, six fires have been set and four people have suffered minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that it had 27 accidents involving the devices in its possession.
Last week, the METI announced that it had received 34 additional reports of overheating from Apple, which it described as "not serious
The Ministry responded by saying that the delay in the report by Apple was'really regrettable'.
The earthquake shook Mariana at 07:19 p.m. (21:19 GMT on Friday)
The Office for Civil Protection of the Northern Marians said that no damage had been reported in the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center had said that there were no indications of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman has taken tourists from Hong Kong as hostages by kidnapping their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot with his M16 rifle at the tourists.
At least six hostages have been rescued and there are at least six confirmed deaths.
Six hostages, including the children and the elderly, were released, as well as the Filipino photographers, who were
The photographers took the place of an elderly lady when she had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in the footsteps of his father and became a doctor.
He trained as a midwife and took up work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working as a hospital doctor, Liggins began to investigate premature labour.
His research showed that the application of a hormone accelerated the lung development of the fetus.
Xinhua reported that investigators from the government have recovered two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Ringer colleagues paid tribute to Luna too.
Tommy Dreamer said: ""Luna was the first queen of extremes. My first manager. Luna died in the night of the two moons. Very unique, exactly like she. A strong woman.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels gave the following comment: "Luna was just as crazy as I was... maybe even crazier... I love her and I will miss her... hopefully she is in a better place.
Of the 1,400 people surveyed in 2010, the share of those who oppose the Australian becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The present-day Prime Minister Julia Gillard during the election campaign for the Federal election in 2010 said that her opinion was that Australia should end its rule over Queen Elizabeth II and become a republic.
34 percent of those surveyed share this view and want that Elizabeth II is the last Australian monarch.
29 per cent of the respondents said Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 per cent of them think Australia should never become a republic.
The gold medal winner at the Olympic Games should swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three-layer heats in the swimming events, but because of his many complaints his fitness was doubted.
He was not able to take the medicines he needed to relieve his pain because they are banned at the Commonwealth Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
A lot of people confirmed the discovery by different hardware and software in February and on Tuesday it was announced.
Cosmic comets may have been a source of water supply for the Earth, together with organic matter that forms proteins and allows life.
As comets collided with the Earth in the distant past, they promise to give us insights into how planets, in particular the Earth, form.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumours as "political nonsense and idle chatter.
It is speculated that he may be nominated for the presidency in 2016.
NextGen is a system, which the FAA claims would allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce CO2 emissions.
It is using satellite-based technology rather than the older technology based on ground radar to enable the air traffic controllers to provide more precise location of aircraft and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
There will be no additional transport facilities established and the underground trains will not stop in Wembley. There are no parking or parking-and-ride facilities available at the site.
With the fear of transport problems growing, the likelihood that the game would be played without the fans of the team behind closed doors grew.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported on the emergence of a new bird species on the ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and at Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new form had developed within just two generations, despite the assumption that it took much longer due to the mating between an indigenous Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant Kaktus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into a variety of forms. It can be rolled into tiny forms.
It can be pulled thin, which can be twisted and woven into strips. It can be hammered or rolled into leaves.
It can be made so thin that it sometimes became a substitute for painting on paper, called calligraphy, to decorate books called calligraphy books.
This is the pH level of a chemical. You can make an indicator with red apple juice.
The citric acid changes its colour according to the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH level points to the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemicals.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electrons (because hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and
Mix the two dry powders together and then shape them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a protective layer.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet in almost every house that was connected to a complex sewage system.
Waste from sewage systems was found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia and China, there were toilets. In Roman culture, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses that men and women visited together.
If you call someone thousands of miles away, use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it almost immediately back down.
The satellite was launched by a rocket into space. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and our view.
It is necessary to launch a giant rocket with a height of more than 100 feet to shoot a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in a way that is unimaginable. The greatest service the wheel has given us is the ability to transport things much faster and easier.
It has brought us the railway, the car and many other means of transport.
In them are cats of medium size, which eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to elephants and rhinos.
Finally, there are still many small cats (including free-roaming domestic cats) that eat much smaller prey animals such as insects, rodents, frogs and
The secret of their success is the niche concept, a special task which every cat has and which ensures that they do not compete with other cats.
Lions are the most social cats. They live in large groups, called herds.
The packs consist of one to three adult males and up to thirty females and young males.
Women tend to have close relationships with each other, when they live in a large family with sisters and daughters.
Lions act similarly to wolf packs or dogs, animals that resemble lions in behavior, but are equally lethal to their prey.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (although not particularly well), swim, long distance jumps and with the fivefold power of a strong man pull.
The tiger is in the same family (genus) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger sounds not like the full-throated roar of the lion, but more like a series of grumbling grumbling words.
Ocelots eat small animals. If they can, they will raid monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than he is.
Scientists think that otters track prey with their sense of smell and find it by sniffing it. They sniff it where they have been.
They can see in the dark very well and move undetected. Ocelot hunters stalk their prey by matching their environment and then attacking.
If a small group of animals (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it comes (for example, if they move over a mountain range or a river or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so that the new population needs to have different characteristics or adaptations in order to be a strong competitor than what it used to.
The original population has not changed at all. It still needs the same adaptations as before.
As time goes by, the new population adapts to their new environment and then they look increasingly like the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, two populations will then look so different that they will no longer be considered the same species.
This process is called specialization, which simply means the emergence of new kinds.
Plants produce oxygen, which people inhale, and they take carbon dioxide out of the air (which is exhaled),
Plants produce their food by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses out of plants and make clothes out of plants. We eat mainly plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the largest predator of its time, so he feared nothing but other Mosasaurs.
His long jaws were equipped with more than 70 sharp teeth, including a second set on the tongue, which meant that there was no escape for any animal that crossed his path.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a hooked tongue. He ate fish, large reptiles, other Mosasaurs, and may even have been a cannibal.
He also took everything that came into the water; even a great dinosaur like the T. Rex was not big enough for him.
While most of their food would be known to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual meals, including wild boar, peacock, snails and a kind of insect called the seven-legged fly.
Another difference was that the poor people and women ate their food sitting on chairs. The rich men preferred to have banquets, where they sat on the side, while they ate their meals.
Roman courts could not contain food that came from America or Asia in later centuries.
They had no wheat, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no Romans ever ate a turkey.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a temple, which was regarded as the house of God.
Man offered sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to conform to the will of the gods through rituals and festivals.
Every temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner altar chamber, which only priests were permitted to enter.
Sometimes, pyramid-shaped towers were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses did not have such a great significance.
The majority of the life of the Hebrew family was played out under the open sky.
The women cooked in the kitchen. Businesses were simply open to the street. For the house building, stone was used.
There were no large forests in Kanaan, so that wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the old Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled for murder. When he traveled further west, he found Greenland and gave it the name Greenland.
But even if it had not been discovered, the Eskimos had lived there long before.
Although all the countries were Nordic, there were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the film "The Templar Legacy", you may think that on the reverse of the Declaration of Independence there was a treasure map drawn.
That is not true. Although on the reverse of the document something is written, it is not a treasure map.
The declaration of independence was written on the reverse side, with the words 'original declaration of independence, dated on the 4th of July 1776'.
Whether or not anyone knows who wrote it is known, but it is known that the great scroll was rolled up at the beginning of its life to be stored.
It is therefore possible that the note was added simply as a label.
The landing on D-Day and the subsequent battles freed the North of France, but the South was still not free.
He was controlled by the 'Vichy' French. These were French who had signed a peace treaty with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders, rather than fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies landed in southern France; the invasion was called 'Operation Dragoon'.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the French liberated the south of France and turned their attention to Germany.
A civilization is a distinctive culture shared by a significant number of people who live together and work, a society.
The word civilisation comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city state and also somehow defines the size of a society.
Cities are the precursors of nations. A civilised culture implies the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint and an appropriate dissemination.
Small crops often disappear without leaving any historical traces and fail to be recognised as genuine civilisations.
While the revolutions fought in the 13 states formed the first weak central government, consisting of only the Congress.
The Congress was not empowered to tax, and there was no national executive or judicial authority, so it relied on the states for the enforcement of its laws.
He had no authority to suspend tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous consent of all the States before they could be changed, and the States took the Central Government so little seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world and was the 2006 FIFA World Champions.
The most popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula One motor racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in northern regions and Italians take part in international competitions and Olympic Games.
Japan has nearly 7000 islands (of which Honshu is the largest) which makes it the seventh largest island in the world.
Because of the cluster/group of islands, Japan is often referred to as an archipelago.
The beginning of Taiwan goes back to the 15th century, when European sailors passed through the island and recorded the name as Ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
The Dutch East India Company establishes a trading post in the south-west of Taiwan in 1624, which initiates a change in the cultivation methods of the indigenous people and employs Chinese labourers on their rice and sugar plantations
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal regions and declared Taiwan to be a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
The Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895 after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895) in which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945." #
Machu Picchu is mainly made up of three buildings, namely the Intihuatana, the sun temple and the room of the three windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea as to how they looked originally.
Up until 1976, thirty per cent of Machu Picchu was restored, and the restoration work continues to this day.
For example, 35 mm is the most widely used format for still photography, which corresponds to the end of the film era in the analog era.
It is still made, but it is more important that its format has been taken over by digital camera sensor formats.
In fact, the 35-mm format is confusingly 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The ratio of this format is therefore called 3:2.
Many of the usual formats (the APS format family, for example) have exactly the same or very similar aspect ratio.
The oft-maligned and often mocked third rule is a simple rule that creates dynamism and at the same time preserves order in a picture.
It states that the intersection of the lines that divide a picture vertically and horizontally is the most effective place for the main motif (see example)." #
In this period of European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church stood on the test.
Since more than a thousand years, Christianity has kept the European states united despite different languages and customs.
His omnipotence ruled over everyone, from the king to the common man.
One of the most important Christian beliefs is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty.
The central authority of the church was in Rome for more than a thousand years. This concentration of power and money led many to doubt whether this principle was adhered to.
In the immediate aftermath of the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective, as it cut off the country from vital military and civilian supplies, despite this blockade violating the generally accepted principles of international law, which have been codified in several international treaties of the last two centuries.
Britain contaminated international waters to prevent ships from penetrating whole oceanic regions, which was a danger for neutral ships as well.
The limited response to this tactic was that Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolation were the dominant attitudes of most citizens and countries.
After the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the nations of Europe wanted to avoid another such situation in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States in order to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the United States with only 4 cents in his pocket, with a book of poetry and a recommendation letter from Charles Batchelor (his previous boss) to Thomas Edison.
The old China had a unique way of showing different eras in China and each family in power was a separate dynasty.
There were also unstable periods of divided provinces between the different dynasties. The most famous of these periods was the period of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and the Jin dynasties.
In these times, there were fierce wars among many nobles vying for the throne.
The time of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died in the struggle for the highest throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a distancing from absolutism to republicanism and nationalism as well as the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a ruler alone.
Also, after the revolution, all professions were open to all male applicants, so that the most ambitious and best of the best could succeed.
The same applies to the military, because the ranks of the army were based on the calibre of the rifle rather than on class membership.
The French Revolution inspired many oppressed people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed was very interested in things that went beyond the everyday life. He often visited a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Nur" (light), to meditate.
The cave itself has survived the times and is a lively picture of Mohammed's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find, even if you know that it exists. Once you are in the cave, you are completely isolated.
You can see nothing but the clear sky above and the numerous surrounding mountains. From the inside of the cave, very little of this world can be seen or heard.
The Cheops Pyramid is the only of the seven wonders of the world which still stands today.
In the third century BC, built by the Egyptians, the Cheops Pyramid is one of many great pyramid structures built to honor the dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau or the "Gizeh Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead comprises several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honour of the Pharaoh Cheops and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honour of his wives and family members.
The "sprinkle" symbol looks like a V and the "sprinkle" symbol looks like a square, where the lower line is missing.
Up" means that you start at the top and then move the arrow down. "Down" means that you start at the bottom and then move the arrow up.
The erasing generates a softer sound, whereas the erasing is more robust and expressive.
You can add your own pencil marks; however, the printed lines are there for musical reasons, so they should be respected in the normal case.
The terrified King Louis XIV, Queen Marie Antoinette, her two small children (the eleven-year-old Marie-Therese and the four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the sister of the King, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris by a mob of market women on 6 October 1789.
They travelled in a carriage back to Paris surrounded by a roaring mob of people threatening the King and the Queen with violence.
The mob forced the King and Queen to open their windows wide.
Sometime a member of the angry mob turned his head in the direction of a corpse in Versailles, the Queen's eyes widening in horror.
The US imperialists' war expenditures in the Philippines were borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the U. S. to cover the bulk of expenditure, and the interest on the bonds flowed through the banks of the Wall Street in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the superprofits that emanated from the continued exploitation of the Filipino people were the fundamental profits of the US imperialism.
To understand the Templars one must understand the context in which the Order was founded.
The period in which the events took place is generally referred to as the Middle Ages, a period of European history which extends over the eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended in approximately 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technology push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that the human fate is determined by a fundamental logic that is linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Many interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas. On the one hand, that the development of technology is a process that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and on the other hand, that technology itself has effects on societies which are more intrinsic than socially determined.
It is possible to say that the car is a necessary part of the development of roads.
Although a national road network for only a small number of cars is economically not sustainable, new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The widespread ownership of cars also leads to higher numbers of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques in the health sector for repairing damaged bodies.
The Romanticism had a strong, cultural deterministic element, which was derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography was the instrument that molded individuals. Over time, customs and cultures developed with reference to this geography and these, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
So, as Paris is now known as the capital of the fashion world of the modern world, so was Constantinople the capital of the feudal Europe.
His fame as the centre of luxury began around 400 BC and lasted until around 1100 AD.
His status declined in the twelfth century, mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices which were regarded as more valuable than the available byzantine markets.
At this time, the title of the world's fashion capital was also transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 14th centuries.
At the beginning, the clothes were strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
But the styles in the West are 25 to 30 years behind the rest of the world.
At the end of the Middle Ages, western Europe began to develop a style of its own. One of the most important developments of the time was that people began to use buttons to fix their clothing.
Needs-based farming is agriculture that is aimed at producing just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer or farmer's family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often biological cultivation method that uses surplus, locally available seeds and uses rotational farming or other relatively simple techniques to maximise yield.
In the past, most farmers practised subsistence farming and in many developing countries this is still the case.
Subcultures bring together people who feel neglected by social norms and enable them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be differentiated on the grounds of age, ethnicity, class, place and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as such can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual or geographical in nature or a combination of these factors.
The members of a subculture often signal their membership by a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits and jargon.
One of the most common ways of illustrating the importance of socialisation is to rely on the few unfortunate cases of children who have not been socialised by adults because of neglect, misfortune or deliberate maltreatment during their childhood.
Those children are called "wild" or "wild." Some wild children were captured by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, the neglect of the child was due to the inability of the parents to accept the severe intellectual or physical limitations of the child.
Wolf cubs may have suffered massive child abuse or suffered traumatic experiences before they were abandoned or escaped.
Others have been raised by animals; some have lived alone in the wilderness.
If it was completely raised by animals, the wild child displays behaviours (in the context of his physical capabilities) which almost completely match those of his specific carer, such as his fear or indifference towards people.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the "scaffolding" approach goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but rather a support that helps individuals in a new learning situation, such as when they are using a new computer program or when they are starting a new project.
Gerüst" and "office-knick" are both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffold, but also the little office-knick in Microsoft Office.
Virtual assistance is built into the software and should question the steps that the student may not be able to complete on his own, suggest alternatives and explain them.
Children are placed in foster homes for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse, and exploitation. 
No child should have to grow up in a home environment that is not nurturing, loving and educationally oriented, but many are forced to do so.
The system of care is a piece of security for these children.
Our family care system should offer a safe home, loving caregivers, a stable education and a reliable health care.
The foster home should cover all the needs that they would not have had in the home from which they were previously removed.
The Internet is a medium for both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific features of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the benefit-and-reward approach.
For example, learning and socialisation are seen as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal engagement and sustained relationships were also identified as new motivational factors by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied the audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings led to important insights into the interpretation of microexpressions, short-lived facial movements.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect whether someone is lying by correctly decoding the facial expressions of a person.
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks showed how people who cannot understand language because of a brain injury can still accurately assess the honesty of people.
He even claims that the ability to interpret human behaviour may be shared with animals such as dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation results in new genetic variations and selection removes these from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with each generation.
Out in the savannah, it is very difficult for a primate with a digestive system like ours to meet its nutritional needs from available plant sources.
In addition, it has serious consequences if you do not: depression, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The easiest to access plant resources would have been proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for us unless they are cooked.
On the other hand, animal food sources (insects, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide large amounts of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
In general, it should not surprise us if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way as chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep compensation is the process of targeted awakening during the normal sleep periods and the subsequent short sleep (10-60 minutes) later.
This can be achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without completely waking you up.
If you are someone who imagines the alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room so that you have to leave the bed to turn it off.
Another method based on the circadian rhythm is to drink a lot of water (especially water or tea, which is known for its urinary-inducing effect) so that you have to get up to go to the toilet.
The degree of inner calm that a person possesses is inversely proportional to the degree of tension in the body and the mind.
The lower the tension is, the more positive the potential of the person's life force. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can attain enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded to include the path of love of the Mahayana and many techniques of the Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (awakening energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
In the centre of the Tibetan meditation is the goddess yoga. Through visualisation of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are opened and the enlightened consciousness is born.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war, the collision of systems, the course and culture of the countries led to the fact that they became enemies.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the cold war began.
He should last for the next 40 years and be carried out in the real world by proxy armies on battlefields in Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defence was already completely broken down and the only hope lay in a withdrawal and a reorganisation along the Romanian bridgehead.
The plans were quickly obsolete, however, when over 800,000 Soviet soldiers invaded the white Russian and Ukrainian fronts and created them after they invaded the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Pact, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
The use of ships for transporting goods is the most efficient way to transport large amounts of people and goods over the seas.
The task of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that a country is able to transport people and goods, and at the same time to hinder the enemy's ability to do so.
One of the most significant recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign in the Second World War. The Americans attempted to bring personnel and material to the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy attempted to stop this traffic mainly with submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Britain exactly as the rest of Europe.
It is believed that goats were domesticated in the Zagros Mountains in Iran approximately 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribal peoples began to keep them as livestock to get easy access to their milk, fur, skin, meat and flesh.
House goats were usually kept in herds that wandered on hills or other pasture areas. They were cared for by goat herders, just like the more familiar sheep herders; often were they children or adolescents. This grazing system is still
In the 16th century, the English built railways.
While the railway tracks consisted of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to travel at higher speeds and to carry heavier loads than on the rougher roads of the time.
Since the beginning of the century, barriers have been introduced to ensure the position of the railway. Gradually, however, it became apparent that railways carrying iron were more efficient.
This was the customary practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron railway tracks were introduced.
The first known means of locomotion was walking. The human species began walking about two million years ago with the appearance of the Homo erectus (which means'standing man').
Your predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk so regularly.
Two-footed species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3,9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can live more sustainably, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate future suffering a little.
In many cases, however, it is merely a symptomatic treatment. If you are not only looking for temporary solutions, then we should find the root of the problem and treat it.
It is really obvious that the world has changed due to the scientific and technological progress of mankind and that the problems have become more serious due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of people.
After its adoption by the Congress on 4 July, a handwritten draft, signed by the Congress President John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to the printers of John Dunlap.
In the course of the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as "Dunlap broadsides.
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon at the Independence Hall on 8 July.
A copy was sent to Washington on July 6, which it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsheets that are still in existence are the oldest still existing copies of the document. The original handwriting has not survived the times.
Many paleontologists now believe that there is a group of dinosaurs that have survived and are still alive. We call them birds.
Many see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and fly.
But many things about birds still look like dinosaurs.
You have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and run on both hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
Almost all of the computers used today are based on the processing of information in binary form.
A binary number can only have one of two values, 0 or 1, and these are called binary digits or bits, to use computer jargon.
A stomach poisoning can be difficult to identify. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that it is difficult to make a diagnosis immediately.
The best sign of a poisoning by ingestion is the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Look for instructions for specific first aid for this particular poison.
The term 'winged insect' is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this insect group.
This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs. These insects are very adaptable to parasitizing people.
So both bed bugs and fleas are nidicolous, that is, adapted to live in their nests or homes.
In the United States of America there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which is the most common neurological disease among adults aged between 20 and 40.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and the peripheral nerves.
Studies have shown that the risk of getting MS is twice as high in women as in men.
A couple can decide that it is not in their own interest or in the interest of their child to raise a baby.
These couples can decide for an adoption plan for their baby.
In adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights, so that another couple can assume parental responsibilities.
The main aim of science is to discover how the world works. This is the basis of most scientific investigations.
However, it is not just about experimentation, where an experiment is a test which is designed to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses.
Natural scientists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts and in particular on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were widely accepted.
With the loss of Greek language skills, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behaviour are often based on the presence of body-specific rhythms and their production by biological clocks.
A series of behaviours that are not only responses to external cycles are known in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that even in absence of external signals continue to oscillate in free-swinging cycles.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the most significant evidences that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacteria.
They took two experiments, in which they either labelled the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphor or a protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the relevant piece of genetic material, and whether it is a germline cell.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Natur tourism draws people to visit areas of natural beauty, including wild plants and animals.
Exemples of activities at the site are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
An example is the visit, the photography and the studying of orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave small provincial towns by car to go to their workplace and are passed by other people whose workplace is at the place they just left.
In this dynamic car-pooling system, all are connected to a transport system based on private cars and support it.
The science now points out that this massive carbon economy has brought about a state of the biosphere which has been in existence for two million years, and which has been the basis of human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone takes part in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
You will rarely hear complaints about water quality or bridge collapses in developed countries.
Why do transport systems fail so often? Why are transport engineers incompetent? Or is something fundamentally wrong going on here?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
It is hard to study traffic flows because one cannot predict driver behaviour with certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave reasonably, so that traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be represented mathematically in a rough way.
To better represent the flow of traffic, the relationships between the three main characteristics have been defined: (1) river, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in planning, designing and operating facilities on the road.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the skies. Their ability to fly helped them to evade enemies more easily and find more efficient food and mates.
Most insects can fold their wings along their bodies.
This means that they have a wider range of small cloaks that they can hide behind.
Today, butterflies and moths are the only insects that can not fold their wings.
In the distant past, a man named Aristarch claimed that the sun was the centre of the movements of the solar system.
Many people thought he was right, but many others believed the opposite: that the solar system including the sun (and even the other stars) move around the earth.
It seems reasonable, because it doesn't seem to me that the earth is moving.
The Amazon is the second longest and the most water-rich river in the world. It flows more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on the planet, partly up to six miles wide.
 Twenty percent of the water that flows through rivers on the planet flows from the Amazon.
The Amazon basin main river is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It takes water from thousands of smaller rivers into it.
Although the building of the pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Gizeh never surpassed their size and technical perfection of their construction.
Egyptians in the ancient New Kingdom admired the monuments of their forefathers, who were then more than a thousand years old.
The Vatican City has approximately 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the smallest population country.
Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language of most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used at religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Fundamental chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known to mankind for thousands of years, since these can be found in their original form in nature and are easily extracted with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, posited the theory that all things are made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air and fire.
This corresponded more to the four aggregate states (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma. He also posited the theory that they would change into new substances to form what we see.
League is a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are regarded as metals. Of course, there are also other metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys which contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
The universe is made up of matter in its entirety. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that billions of them would fit in the point at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was invented by many people to be a good friend to many people.
Despite the introduction of new writing methods, the pencil has been marginalised in its status and use, so that it has been pushed back into the background.
Today, people write their messages on computer screens, without ever having to get close to a rocket launcher.
We should be looking forward to the new keyboard that will be produced when something new comes along.
The atomic bomb is based on the principle that energy is needed to combine a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like if you were to roll a heavy car up a hill. If the core is split, some of this energy will be released.
Some atoms have unstable cores, which means that they will break down even at the slightest spark.
The surface of the moon consists of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The outer shell is about 70 km thick on the near side and about 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the sea and thicker under the highlands.
On the near side, there could be more Maria, because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Theoretical theories concentrate on finding what people are motivated by or attracted to.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or wishes that are internalized during their adulthood.
The theories concern what causes certain people to want exactly the things they do, and what influences them to do or not to do certain things in their environment.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two behaviours can be discerned when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the boys" (or of the girls) or to become a "manager".
This kind of manager has problems in making unpopular decisions, disciplining employees, carrying out performance appraisals, assigning responsibilities and enforcing discipline.
At the other end of the spectrum, you become an unrecognizable individual who has to do everything differently than the team has done and takes everything on its own.
The ultimate responsibility for the success or failure of the team lies with the team leader.
This behavior often leads to friction between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are managed in the same way as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members have for their immediate physical group often the function of a contact point.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams can meet in different time zones that may not be taken into account by the local management.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also an unique part of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the leadership team that reports to each member. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organisation undertake the time-consuming process of introducing an organisational learning concept? A goal for the practical implementation of organisational learning concepts is innovation.
If all the available resources are effectively used by all the departments of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can arise.
In the end, the joint work of an organisation on overcoming a hindrance can lead to a new innovative procedure on responding to customer needs.
Before an organisation can be innovative, the leadership must develop a culture of innovation and shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the concept of the continuum as a way of helping organizations to become more effective.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. This limits the research field and makes it much more precise.
Correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that various types of brain damage, such as trauma, injuries and tumours, influence behaviour and cause changes in some brain functions.
New emerging technologies enable us to see certain brain structures and processes for the first time and to explore them.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that will help us understand the processes in our heads.
KI is not only strongly associated with science fiction, but is also a major branch of computer science concerned with behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in the field of AI includes the production of machines for automating tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Exemples of this are control, the setting of strategies and timetables, the ability to answer customer questions and queries, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Things like these have become independent disciplines, which are focused on finding solutions for real-life problems.
The KI system is now being increasingly used in the areas of economics, medicine, engineering and military, and is also incorporated into numerous software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of every school class. Often, a teacher would like to take her pupils to places where a bus journey is not possible.
Virtual excursions are a technical solution. The pupils can view museum pieces from their classroom, visit aquariums or admire beautiful artworks.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and to share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design each year a website about their trip to the capital of the state. The website is updated each year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a collection album.
Blogs can also help improve the writing skills of students. Although students at the beginning of their blog experience often have a sloppy grammar and spelling, that changes usually as a result of a readership.
Students are often a very critical audience, so the blogger tries to improve his writing style to avoid criticism.
The blogging forces the students to learn more about the world around them. The need to arouse public interest inspires the students to write smart and interesting.
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to continue learning outside of the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can enable pupils to become more analytical and critical; by responding to Internet material, pupils can define their own positions in the context of texts by others and present their own perspectives on certain topics.
Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital of Canada and is home to a number of art galleries and museums that present Canada's past and present.
In the south are the Niagara Falls, and in the north the untouched beauty of nature extends to Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and other things make Ontario unique as what is regarded as typical of Canada from the outside.
A large area further north is sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that many surprises: There are more African-Americans in the US than Canadian citizens.
The islands in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Africa are located.
Madagaskar is by far the largest and, as far as the animal world is concerned, a separate continent.
The majority of the smaller islands are independent nations or attached to France and are known as luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam into the country, and in the Comoros and Mayotte, it was very successful.
The European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
The region is bounded by the Sahel zone in the north and the Atlantic Ocean in the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female travellers should claim to be married, irrespective of their actual marital status.

Women should recognise that cultural differences can lead to what they regard as an assault and that it is not uncommon to be beaten, handcuffed, etc.
Keep your stand firm when you reject men and do not hesitate to defend your position (cultural differences aside; that does not mean that it is okay!)
Today's Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Merinides as a strategic port with the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed them and rebuilt them under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon them after a quake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan built the city as Dar el Beida again and it was called Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
It is easy to find traditional Moroccan goods such as Tagines, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of tinned food, but that is all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city centre.
While Goma is relatively safe, it is important to plan your stay outside Goma carefully to find out the state of the ongoing fighting in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of the Nyiragongo Volcano as well as for some of the cheapest gorilla tracking tours in Africa.
You can use Bodabodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The usual (local) fare is ~500 Congolese Francs for the short ride
This in combination with its relative remoteness has made "Timbuktu" a metaphor for exotic, far-off countries.
Although Timbuktu is a tourist attraction and has a airport, it is now a poor city.
In 1990 it was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger because of the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the most significant stops on Louis Gates' PBS special "Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the cities of the country, because it is more of an Arab than an African atmosphere.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa. It borders in the east with Mozambique, in the north with Zimbabwe and in
The park has an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecosystems, each supporting a different animal world.
He is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered to be the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As all national parks in South Africa, the Kruger National Park charges daily entry fees.
It may also be worth buying a wild card that allows you to enter either to selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the namesake of the territory of Hong Kong and is the focus of many tourists.
The buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline were compared to a shimmering bar chart that is visible through the presence of the waters of the Victoria Harbour.
For the best prospects for Hong Kong, you should leave the island and drive to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
The bulk of the city formation of Hong Kong Island is concentrated along the newly acquired coastline.
This is the place that the British colonists have taken over. If you look for traces of colonial past in the area, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forest in the world and extend over 80 km from the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland to the coast.
The Sundarbans were declared a UNESCO world heritage site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is known as Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not only mangrove swamps - they also encompass some of the last remaining remnants of the mighty jungle that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans stretch over an area of 3,850 km2, of which a third is covered by water and marshes.
The Sundarbans are a nature reserve since 1966 and estimates indicate that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer there.
Buses run all day long from the district-wide bus station (on the other side of the river) and leave at all times between 06:30 and 07:30 hours.
As the buses are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket in advance.
Most districts are being driven by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
Taxi services are a fast and comfortable way to get to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a curved cable bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana." #
Your two towers are 83 metres high, their length is 378 metres and they have two carriageways with 3,50 m width.
The bridge's height is 15 meters. The construction work was completed in August 2011 and the opening for traffic took place in March 2017.
The bridge will be fully operational by September 2017. It is expected that the Brazilian customs checkpoints will then be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group that inhabited the present-day eastern Paraguay. They lived as seminomadic hunters, who also
The Chaco region was also home to other indigenous groups, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering and
Paraguay, formerly the province of West Indies, was formed in the 16th century as a result of the meeting of the Spanish conquistadors with the i
The Spanish began colonization, which lasted for three centuries.
Since 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is renowned for its polo team and its players to be among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at Las Cañitas Polo fields.
Small tournaments and competitions can be watched here at other times of the year.
Informations about polo competitions and sales outlets for polo tickets can be found at the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is set in accordance with the value of the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged in the only bank on the island, which is located opposite the FIC West Store.
The pound will be accepted everywhere on the islands and at Stanley credit cards. Also US dollars are often accepted.
In the remote islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, but British and American currency can be accepted; ask the owners in advance about the payment method that is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange the currency of the Falkland Islands outside the islands themselves, so you should exchange your money before you leave the islands.
Montevideo is located south of the equator, so it is there in summer when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the tropics. In the summer months, temperatures above +30 °C are common.
The winter can be misleadingly cold: The temperatures rarely go below freezing point, but wind and moisture lead to feeling colder than what the thermometer shows.
There are no distinct wet and dry seasons: The amount of rainfall remains approximately constant throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to the sight of humans, they are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the instructions of the park authorities, visitors should keep at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals.
Even if Bisons, Wapitis, Elches, Bears and all the big animals look peaceful, it can still happen that they turn on each other.
Each year hundreds of visitors are injured because they do not take enough space. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so leave them enough space.
Also, be aware that odours attract bears and other wildlife. Avoid carrying strong-smelling foods or cooking them, and be sure to keep a clean camp.
Apia is the capital of the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 18th century and is the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a shameful stalemate in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships except one British warship were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans died.
While the Mau-Mau movement was organising the independence struggle, a peaceful meeting in the city led to the killing of the top leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
As Auckland is spread over two harbours, there are many beaches. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the district of North Harbour) lie on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Most of the beaches are sandy with safe swimming areas and most offer shade from the Pohutukawa trees that are donated.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located at the Waitemata Harbour, in the upper suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
There are family beaches, which are sometimes overcrowded, with a beautiful shopping promenade along the coast. Swimming here is safe.
The most important local beer is "Number One". It is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is "Manta".
There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines are probably better tolerated.
Local tap water can be safely consumed, but if you are concerned, you will also find easily available bottled water.
For Australians, the idea of coffee ""flat white"" is foreign. A small black is ""espresso"" and a cappuccino is served with foam (not with milk) and tea is served without milk
Hot chocolate is Belgian standard. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many trips to the reef take place all year round and injuries caused by any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Although you should follow the advice of authorities, pay particular attention to warnings and especially to security warnings.
Shellfish are common in the vicinity of beaches and in the vicinity of river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can also occur outside this period." #
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and would run away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live in the sea, their primary habitat is in river mouths north of Rockhampton.
A reservation in advance gives the traveller the assurance that he will have a place to stay when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although you may also book other accommodation forms, such as camping sites, through a travel agency.
Travel agents typically offer packages in which breakfast, transport to and from the airport, or even a combination of flight and hotel are included.
You can also hold your reservation for you if you need time to reconsider the offer or to obtain further documents for your destination (for example, a visa).
Any changes or requests should however be made first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
Some festivals are decided by a large majority of festivalgoers to camp out, and most visitors believe this to be an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you must get there early to get a campsite near the music.
Think of it as a festival that continues into the night, even though the main stages have stopped playing music.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the North Sea in winter, check the state of the cabin, because the breaking of ice can cause quite a lot of noise for the most affected.
The cruise ships to Saint Petersburg also offer time for a stay in the city. Passengers on cruises are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos generally try to keep their guests as long as possible and to spend a lot of money.
They usually have a special offer of food, drinks and entertainment to keep the guests happy and ensure that they stay.
Some casinos offer alcoholic beverages free of charge. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good players know how important it is to remain sober." #
Anyone wishing to travel in high latitudes or over mountain passes should be prepared for snow, ice and temperatures below freezing.
On icy and snowy roads, the liability is low and one can not drive as if one were on bare asphalt.
In very short time, so much snow can fall that you can get stuck.
The visibility can also be affected by falling or drifting snow or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, cold and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and the traffic runs all year round largely uninterrupted.
Safaris are perhaps the greatest tourist attraction in Africa and the culmination of many visitors' experiences.
Safari is a term used in everyday language to describe a trip to see the overwhelming wildlife of Africa, especially in the Savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars close, and the standard equipment provides good visibility.
Lions, leopards and cheetahs are often timid and you can observe them better with a telescope.
A bushwalk (also known as a bushwalk, bushwalking or footing) consists of a walk that lasts for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held elsewhere in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Olympic Games after having already hosted the Games in 1964.
If you have booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the rescheduling was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
The cancellation policies vary, but most of them did not apply until the end of March, for the Olympic Games that were planned for the end of July.
It is assumed that most tickets will cost between 2,500¥ and 130,000¥, a typical ticket will be about 7,000¥.
Washing clothes can help drying. Many hotels provide irons and ironing boards, even if you are not present in the room.
If there is no iron available or you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can try to use a hairdryer if one is available.
Be careful that the material does not get too hot (it can shrink it or lead to burns in extreme cases).
There are different methods for cleaning water. Some of them are more effective than others in preventing certain threats.
In some areas it is enough to boil water for a minute, in others it must be several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you have any concerns, then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter livestock pests which they do not know from their home regions.
Invasive species can destroy food, cause irritation or even cause allergic reactions, poison or transmit disease.
Infections as such or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people are seldom classed as vermin.
Free trade is the opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from duties and consumption taxes at certain locations.
Travellers who have a destination with a high tax rate can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, particularly in the case of alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmount on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway is the most challenging driving section, as it often leads through remote, undeveloped country.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: steep gradients, narrow roads and sharp turns predominate here.
The speed limits given are noticeably lower than in the previous and following sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict compliance with them is even more important than usual.
But interestingly, the mobile phone coverage here is much better than in many other areas of the route, for example, the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German bread is very tasty. In Bavaria, it is very rich and varied, as well as in Austria.
Obstgebäck is very common, with apples being cooked all year round and pears and plums being used in summer.
Many German cakes also contain nuts, almonds or other nuts. Popular cakes often fit particularly well to a cup of strong coffee.
If you wish to produce small, but rich cakes, then try this, which is called Berliner, pancakes or crêpes in different regions.
A curry is a dish that is based on herbs and spices, with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either dry or wet depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is usually used in curries; in South India and in some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is
With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a catch-all term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines that are found throughout the country.
When the term is used without any further attributes, it usually refers to the food that originated from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine, which is now widely spread throughout the archipelago, offers a range of simple spiced dishes. As flavouring agents they prefer nuts, chillies, sugar (especially javanese coconut sugar) and a whole host of aromatic spices." #
Stitching is a kind of footwear for the riders, which hang down from both sides of the saddle.
They give the horse more stability, but there are security concerns because the feet of the horse may get caught in them.
If a rider falls off the horse and hooks his foot on the stirrup, he can be pulled along if the horse passes. To minimize this risk, a number of precautions can be taken.
First of all, most of the horses wear boots with a flat sole and a smooth, narrow heel.
In addition, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety buckles which allow a saddle cinch to fall off when it is pulled off by a falling rider.
The Cochamó Valley – Chile's most important climbing destination, known as the Yosemite National Park of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and -cliffs.
The summits offer a breathtaking view. Climbers from all over the world discover new routes along the walls that offer endless opportunities.
Skiing and snowboarding are popular sports, in which you attach skis or a snowboard to your feet and descend a slope on a snow covered surface.
Skiing is a popular holiday activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as'ski-bunnies', who plan their entire holiday around the skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers go back to 5000 BC!
The origins of skiing as a sport go back at least to the 17th century and in 1861 the first ski club in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Skitouring with pack: This activity is also called ski touring or ski walking.
It resembles alpine skiing or mountaineering, but it does not necessarily involve these, as they are carried out in steep terrain and require much stiffer skis and boots.
Please treat the ski route as a comparable hiking route.
If you have good conditions, you can go further than you would on a walking trip – only very rarely will you reach the speed of the cross-country skiing on well-maintained trails without a heavy pack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries. Normally, you would have to apply for multiple visas and go through multiple passport controls if you want to travel through more than one country.
The Schengen area works in this respect somewhat like a country.
So long as you remain within this zone, you can usually cross the border without having to go through the passport control again.
In accordance with Article 3, paragraph 1, of the Treaty, you must not apply for a Schengen visa for each of the Schengen States separately, which saves time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universally accepted definition of what is an antique. Some tax authorities define over 100 years old goods as antiquities.
The definition shows geographical differences, where the age limit may be lower in areas like North America than in Europe.
Handcrafted products may be referred to as "antique" even though they are younger than similar products produced in mass production.
The reindeer breeding industry is a major source of livelihood for the Sámi, and the culture around trade is also important for many who work in other professions.
Also, too, in the past, not all Sámi have bred reindeer, but have lived mainly from fishing, hunting and so on. Reindeer have been their main livestock.
Many Sámi work in modern jobs. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.

Regional and seasonal weather phenomena are, for example, blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
Travellers are urged to be on the lookout for any type of weather that affects their area, as this can have a major impact on all travel plans
Everyone planning to travel to a country that is a war zone should have a professional training for that.
A search on the Internet for ""course on hostile environments"" will probably show the address of a local company.
A course covers most of the issues discussed here in a much more detailed way, usually in combination with practical experience.
A course is usually between 2 and 5 days long and includes role-playing, lots of first aid and sometimes training in weapons.
There are many books and journals on survival in the wild, but very few publications on conflict zones.
Travellers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure that they have valid identity documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with no specified gender (X) or documents that have been updated to reflect the desired name and gender, is different.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognise these documents is also very different.
The searches at security checkpoints have become more intrusive since 11 September.
Transgender people should not expect that their privacy and dignity will be intact when passing the scanner.
Riss currents are the return current of broken waves, often at reefs or similar.
Because of the underwater topology, the flow in a few deeper areas and a fast current can form there.
The majority of deaths (77,1 %) were due to fatigue trying to swim against the current, which proved to be impossible.
When you get out of the current, it is not difficult to get back in.
Please try to get somewhere where you are not caught again. Alternatively, if you are noticed, perhaps you should wait for rescue.
The shock to the return is earlier than the shock to the honeymoon phase, lasts longer and is more severe.
Travellers who adapted easily to the new culture were often particularly hard-pressed to adapt to their home culture.
When you come back from an overseas trip, you have adapted to a different culture and have abandoned some of the customs of your home culture.
As you went abroad for the first time, people were probably patient and understanding because they knew that travellers had to adapt to a new country.
Maybe we do not expect that returning travellers should be treated with patience and understanding.
The sound and light show at the Pyramids is one of the most interesting attractions for children in the region.
You can see the Pyramids in the dark and while it is still quiet, before the show begins.

The northern part or the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains of the Antarctic, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak is the Mount Vinson, at 4892 m.
In remote areas without mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone can be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a substitute for a mobile phone, since you have to be in clear sight of a satellite and be able to make a call.
The service is often used by ships, including pleasure ships, and expeditions that require data and voice links.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you further information about the connection to this service.
An ever more popular option for people who are planning to take a year off, are study and course opportunities abroad.
This is particularly popular among university graduates, as it allows them to take a year off before university without affecting their studies.
In many cases, taking part in a transnational mobility programme can actually improve your chances of getting a higher education in your home country.
In general, fees are levied for registration to these educational programmes.
Finland is a great destination for boat tours. The "land of the thousand lakes" has also thousands of islands - in the lakes and in the archipelagoes." #
For the archipelagoes and lakes, you do not need a boat.
Also, even though the coastal island groups and the largest lakes are actually big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is the national pastime in Finland, one in six or eight owns a boat.
This is similar to Sweden, Norway and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, one to fourty.)
The majority of pure eastbound cruises include a longer stay in St Petersburg in Russia.
That means that you can visit the historic city for a whole day while you are on the ship and then return home and stay overnight.
If you only go on a tour of the countryside, you do not need a separate visa (Stand 2009).
Some cruises offer Berlin as a destination in Germany. You can see on the map above that Berlin is far from the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Travelling can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and from all walks of life, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience behind them.

More about the functioning of aircraft and the processes during a flight can help some to overcome the fear that is associated with the unknown or with the feeling that they do not have control.
Courier companies are paid well for the speedy delivery of things. Often, the time is an extremely important factor in corporate documents, trade goods or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the larger firms use their own aircraft, but on other routes and with smaller firms there were difficulties.
If they shipped things via air freight, the loading and customs clearance could take several days on some routes.
The only way to get it done faster was to send it as a baggage." The rules of the airline allow you to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly in First or Business class is to add a hefty wad of cash to the privilege (or, better still, to force your own company to pay for it).
That is, however, not cheap: As a rough guide, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business and first class.
It is pointless to look for discounts on direct flights from A to B even on business or first class seats.
The airlines know very well that there is a certain core group of passengers who are prepared to pay a lot of money to get to their destination quickly and conveniently and demand appropriate prices.
The capital of Moldavia is Kishinev. The native language is Romanian, but many people speak Russian.
Moldawien is a multiethnic state, which has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
The conflict in 1994 led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
While the political negotiations failed, economic relations between these two parts of the Republic of Moldova were restored.
The most important religion in Moldavia is the Christian Orthodox.

Do not damage the site by painting or scratching graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer Catalan, the majority understands it, and so many can speak Spanish.
Most of the signs are however only in Catalan, as it is laid down as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other institutions.
Normal announcements are made in the Metro exclusively in Catalan, but unforeseen disturbances are reported by an automated system in a multitude of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are said to be arrogant, unfriendly and uncouth.

The crude exterior of Paris disappears very quickly if you take basic manners into account.
The Plitwitzer Seen National Park is heavily forested, with mainly coniferous and Mediterranean vegetation.
He has a remarkable diversity of microclimates, different soils and different altitudes, and this diversity is reflected in the variety of plant communities.
The area is also home to a very large diversity of animal and bird species.
There are rare fauna like European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, foxes, wild cats and wild hens, as well as many more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts that reach to the knees and cover their shoulders.
In most monasteries there are no dresses for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own with you, especially a brightly coloured one, the monk or nun will smile at you at the gate.
In analogy to this, men must wear trousers that reach to the knees.
Also these can be borrowed from the collection, but the clothes are not washed after each user, so you may not feel comfortable in these shirts." For men there is a standard size!
The mallorcan cuisine is based, as in similar areas of the Mediterranean, on bread, vegetables and meat (in particular pork) and uses olive oil.
A simple popular evening meal, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any available ingredient such as cheese, tuna etc.
All nouns begin with a capital letter after the word you for ""you"" always, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is a useful way of distinguishing between some verbs and objects.
It makes reading easier, but writing is a little bit difficult because you have to check whether a verb or a noun is used as the main word.
The Italian pronunciation is relatively simple, since most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.

As the light pollution during its peak period did not pose a problem that it does today, they are usually found in cities or on university grounds that are easier to reach than those built in recent times.
The most modern research telescopes are massive structures in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The viewing of the cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture for over eight centuries.
