This confirms not only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides details that fossils in general cannot provide, such as colour and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the fur of this animal was on the top of the head brown and on the bottom of the head light or carotinoid colored.
The find also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well developed sheath called a quill, but other characteristics of feathers — hooks and barbules — the researchers concluded that the quill must have been an evolutionary development later than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or for the heartbeat.
Researchers claimed that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows no feathers and no tail feathers.

The candidates can send representatives to witness every stage of the process. At night, the votes will be counted by volunteers under strict supervision and in accordance with special procedures.

The road, on which the accident occurred, was temporarily closed while the emergency services tended to the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
In consequence, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was subsequently charged with murdering her son.
She is in custody until the indictment and trial, but eyewitness statements may be exaggerated because of the widespread publication of her image.
This is a practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish judiciary works differently, and the courts have considered the publication of photographs as potentially harmful.
Professorin Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee points out: "Journalists seem to be crossing a dangerous line when they publish photographs or other material of suspects.
The Crown Office, which is the lead agency in the criminal investigation, has hinted to journalists that at least until the prosecution no further comments will be made.
According to a leak, the document refers to the border dispute in which the Palestinians are demanding a reversal of the borders in the state of 1967.
Other issues, which are allegedly covered, include the future of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel wants a military presence in the Jordan Valley for ten years from the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority is willing to accept a five-year presence only.
The shooters of the accompanying trial to control the plague should be closely supervised by rangers, as the trial was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., volunteers were recruited to assist with the hunting programme of the Sporting Shooters Association." #
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Managing Director of Park Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the four selected hunters received comprehensive security and training training.
Martelly has yesterday appointed a new provisional election commission (CEP) comprising nine members.
It is his fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of the package of measures aimed at steering the country in the direction of new elections.
The Commission was the response of President Martelly to the widespread regime-critical protests that began in October.
The trigger for the sometimes violent protests was the failure to hold elections, some of which are due to be held in 2011.
There have been over 60 cases of overheating due to defective iPods reported. In total, six fires were set and four people have suffered minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that it had 27 accidents in connection with the devices.
Last week, the METI announced that it had received 34 reports of overheating from Apple, which it described as "not serious
The Ministry reacted by saying that the delay of the report by Apple was "really regrettable.
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 p.m. local time (21:19 GMT on Friday)
The Civil Protection Department of the Northern Marians said that no damage had been reported in the country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center had declared that there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman has taken tourists from Hong Kong as hostages by kidnapping their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot with his M16 rifle at the tourists.
At least six hostages have been rescued and there have been confirmed deaths.
Six hostages, including the children and the elderly, were released, as well as the Filipino photographers, early on
The photographers took the place of an elderly lady when she had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in the footsteps of his father and chose a medical career.
He went on to become a maternity doctor and took up his work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959
While working in the hospital, Liggins began to study premature contractions.
His research showed that the application of a hormone accelerated the lung development of the fetus.
Xinhua reported that investigators from the government on Wednesday recovered two "black box" flight recorders.
Ringer colleagues paid tribute to Luna as well.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of extremes. My first manager. Luna died in the night of the two moons. Very unique, exactly like she. A strong woman.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels gave the following comment: "Luna was just as crazy as I was... maybe even crazier... I love her and I will miss her... hopefully she is in a better place.
From the 1,400 people who were surveyed in the run-up to the 2010 federal elections, the proportion of those who oppose Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The present-day Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the election campaign for the Federal election 2010, that her opinion was that Australia would end the reign of Queen Elizabeth II as a republic.
34 per cent of those surveyed share this view and want that Elizabeth II is the last Australian monarch.
29 per cent of respondents said that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 per cent of respondents said that Australia should never become a republic.
The gold medal winner at the Olympic Games should swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle as well as in three-person relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but because of his many complaints about his fitness, his fitness was
He was not able to take the necessary medication to relieve his pain because they are banned at the Commonwealth Games.
On 25 January, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Many people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software in February and on Tuesday it was announced.
Cosmic dust may have been a source of water supply for the Earth, together with organic matter which may have formed proteins and enabled life.
Comets collided with the Earth long ago, and scientists are hoping to gain insights into how planets, in particular the Earth, form.
Cuomo (53) took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He described the rumours as 'political nonsense and idle chatter'.
It is speculated that he may be seeking the Presidency in 2016.
NextGen is a system claimed by the FAA that it would allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology rather than the older technology based on ground radar to enable the air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
There will not be any additional transport facilities established and the underground trains will not stop at Wembley. There are no parking or parking-and-ride facilities available there.
With the fear of inadequate transport facilities, the likelihood grew that the game would be played without the fans of the team.
A study published on Thursday in the Science journal reported the emergence of a new bird species on the ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and at Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species had developed within just two generations, although it had previously been assumed that this process took much longer due to the mating between a native Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant Kaktus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be rolled into a number of different forms.
You can pull a thin cord, which can be twisted and woven into a rope. It can be hammered or rolled into leaves.
It can be made very thin and glued to another metal. It can be made so thin that it sometimes was used to decorate handwritten pictures, called picture manuscripts, in books called picture manuscripts.
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
The citric acid changes its colour depending on how acidic or basic the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemicals.
Protons are electrons that have been removed from water molecules (because water molecules consist of a proton and an electron)." #
Mix the two powders together and then form them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a protective layer.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets in almost every house that were connected to a sewage system." #
Remains of sewage systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia and China, there were toilets. In Roman culture, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses that men and women visited in mixed company.
If you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back down almost immediately.
The satellite was launched by a rocket into space. Scientists use telescopes in space, because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and our view.
It is necessary to launch a gigantic rocket with a height of more than 100 feet to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest service it has given us is much easier and faster transport.
It has brought us the railway, the car and many other modes of transport.
In this group are medium-sized cats that eat prey of medium size, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-roaming domestic cats) that eat much smaller prey, such as insects, rodents, amphibians and
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a special task which every cat has and which ensures that they do not compete with other cats.
Lions are the most social cats. They live in large groups, which are called herds.
The herds consist of one to three adult males and up to thirty females and young.
Women usually have a close relationship with each other, when they live in a large family with sisters and daughters.
The lions of the media and politics behave in a similar way to wolves and dogs, animals that surprise the lion (but not other big cats) in their behaviour and are equally
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (although not particularly well), swim, long distances jump and with the fivefold power of a strong person pull.
The tiger is in the same family (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar." #
The roar of the tiger sounds not like the full-throated roar of the lion, but more like a series of grumbling grumbling words.
Ocelot hunters eat small animals. If they can, they will steal monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than he is.
Scientists think that otters track animals for food (prey) with their olfactory sense and find them by sniffing where they have been.
They can see in the dark very well and move undetected. Ocelots hunt their prey by matching their environment visually and then attacking it.
If a small group of animals (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it comes (for example, if they move over a mountain range or a river or if they move to a new island, so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has other resources and other competitors, so that the new population needs different characteristics or adaptations in order to be a strong competitor than what it used to need.
The original population has not changed at all. It still needs to adapt itself to the same changes as before.
As time goes by, the new population adapts to their new environment, and then they look less and less like the other population.
After tens of thousands or even millions of years, two populations will look so different that they will no longer be considered the same species.
This process is called specialization, which simply means the emergence of new species. It is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that we breathe, and they take carbon dioxide out of the air that we exhale (that is, exhale).
Plants produce their food by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses out of plants and make clothes out of plants. We eat mainly plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the largest predator of its time, so it feared nothing but other Mosasaurs.
His long jaws were equipped with more than 70 sharp teeth, including a further set on the tongue, which meant that there was no escape for any animal that crossed his path.
We do not know for sure, but he may have had a hooked tongue. He fed on sea-lions, large fish, other Mosasaurs and may even have been a cannibal.
He also took everything that came into the water; even a great dinosaur like the T. Rex was not big enough for him.
While most of their food is known to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual meals, including wild boar, peacock, snails and a kind of rodent called the seven-headed snake.
Another difference was that the poor people ate their food on chairs. The rich men preferred to hold banquets where they sat on the side, while they ate their meals.
Ancient Roman courts could not contain food that came from America or Asia in later centuries.
They had no wheat, no tomatoes, no potatoes, and no Romans ever ate a turkey.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a temple, which was regarded as the house of the god.
Man offered sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to comply with the will of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had a public temple courtyard and then an inner temple courtyard, which was only accessible by priests.
Often, special pyramid-shaped temples were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses did not have such a great significance.
The majority of the life of the Hebrew family took place under the open sky.
The women cooked in the yard. Shops consisted of open shop fronts. To build a house, stone was used.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the old Norse legends, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder. When he traveled further west, he found Greenland and gave it the name Greenland.
But regardless of its discovery, the Eskimos lived there long before that.
Although all the countries were Nordic, there were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the film 'The Templar's Legacy', you may think that on the back of the Declaration of Independence there was a map of treasure.
That is not true. Although on the back of the document something is written, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the declaration of independence, the words "original declaration of independence, dated on the 4th of July 1776" were written. The text is written on the top of the document.
Whether or not it was written by someone, it is known that the great scroll (which measures 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up at the beginning of its life to be stored.
It is therefore possible that the label simply was added.
The landing on D-Day and the subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
He was controlled by the "Vichy"" French. These were Frenchmen who signed a peace treaty with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders, rather than fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies landed in southern France; the invasion was called ‘Operation Dragoon’.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the French liberated the south of France and turned their attention towards Germany.
A civilization is a distinct culture shared by a significant number of people who live together and work, a society.
The word 'civilisation' comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin word civis, which means citizen and civitas, which means city or city state and also somehow defines the size of a society.
Cities are the forerunners of nations. A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint and an appropriate dissemination.
Small cultures are often lost without leaving any significant historical evidence and fail to be recognised as genuine civilisations.
While the revolutions fought in the 13 States formed the first central government, consisting of the Congress,
The Congress was not empowered to tax, and there was no national executive or judicial authority, so it relied on the states, which often did not cooperate.
He had no power to annul tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous approval of all States before they could be changed, and the States took the Central Government so little seriously that their representatives seldom absented themselves.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world and was 2006 FIFA World Cup champion.
Favourite sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula One motor racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in northern regions and Italians take part in international competitions and Olympic Games.
Japan has nearly 7000 islands (of which Honshu is the largest), making it the seventh largest island in the world.
Because of the cluster of islands, Japan is often referred to as an archipelago.
The beginning of Taiwan can be dated back to the 15th century, when European sailors passed by and recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
In 1624 the Dutch East India Company established a trading post in the south-west of Taiwan, which led to a change in the cultivation methods of the indigenous peoples and employed Chinese labourers on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan and declared it a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
The Qing dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War, in which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists mainly of three buildings, namely the Intihuatana, the Sun Temple and the Space of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better impression of how they looked originally.
Up until 1976, thirty per cent of Machu Picchu was restored, and the restoration work continues to this day.
For example, 35 mm is the most widely used film format in the world at the end of the analog film era.
It is still made today, but it is more important that its image format has been taken over by digital camera sensor formats.
In fact, the 35-mm-format is confusingly 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve, to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore referred to as 3:2.
Many of the common formats (for example, the APS format family) have exactly the same or very similar aspect ratio.
The much-maligned and often mocked third-rail rule is a simple directive that creates dynamism and balances out a picture.
It states that the intersection of the lines that divide a picture vertically and horizontally is the most effective place for the main motif (see example)." #
In this period of European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church was under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has kept the European states united despite the different languages and customs.
His omnipotence ruled every one, from the king to the common man.
One of the most important Christian beliefs is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty.
The central authority of the church was in Rome for more than a thousand years. This concentration of power and money led many to doubt whether this principle had been met.
In the immediate aftermath of fighting breaking out in Germany, Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective because it cut off vital military and civilian supplies from the country, despite this blockade contravening the generally accepted principles of international law, which have been codified in several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain contaminated international waters to prevent ships from penetrating whole oceans, which was a threat to neutral ships as well.
The response to this tactic was limited, and Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s pacifism and isolation were the dominant attitudes of most citizens and countries.
After the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the nations wanted to avoid another such situation in the future.
1884 he moved to the United States of America to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, with a book of poems and a recommendation letter from Charles Batchelor (his superior at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
The ancient China had a unique way of showing different eras. Each era in China and each family in power was a separate dynasty.
In between the different dynasties there were also unstable times of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the period of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and the Jin Dynasties.
In these times, there were bitter wars among many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The time of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people have died in the struggle for the highest throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metrical system, a departure from absolutism towards republicanism and nationalism as well as the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a ruler alone.
Also, all professions were open to all male applicants, so that the most ambitious and best of them could succeed.
The same applies to the military, since the ranks were based on the calibre of the weapons rather than on class membership.
The French Revolution inspired many oppressed people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed was very interested in things that went beyond the everyday life. He often visited a cave that was known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Nur" (Light) to meditate.
The cave itself has survived the times and offers a lively picture of Mohammed's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find, even if you know that it exists. Once you are in the cave, you are completely isolated.
There is nothing but the clear, beautiful sky above and the numerous surrounding mountains. From the inside of the cave, very little of this world can be seen or heard.
The Cheops Pyramid is the only of the Seven Wonders of the World which still stands.
The Cheops Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C. and is one of many great pyramid structures built to honor the dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau or the 'Gizeh Necropolis' in Egypt comprises several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built to honour the Pharaoh Cheops and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honour his wives and family members.
The "dressing" symbol looks like a V and the "removing" symbol looks like a square, with the lower line missing.
Up means that you should start at the top and pull the bow; down means that you should start at the Frog (where your hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
The erasing produces a softer sound, while the erasing is more powerful and expressive.
You are free to add your own pencil marks; however, the printed lines are there for musical reasons, so they should be respected.
The King of France, Marie Antoinette, her two small children (Marie-Therese, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old) and the sister of the King, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris by a mob of market women on 6 October 1789.
They travelled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a mob of people who threatened the king and queen with violence.
The mob forced the king and queen to open their windows wide.
Sometime later a member of the angry mob turned his head in the direction of a royal guard killed in Versailles.
The US imperialists' war expenditures in the Philippines were borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States, to cover the bulk of the expenditure, and the interest on the bonds flowed through the banks of Wall Street in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the superprofits that derive from the continued exploitation of the Filipino people were the fundamental profits of the US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you first have to understand the context in which they were founded.
The period in which the events took place is generally referred to as the Middle Ages, a period in European history that spanned the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended in approximately 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept which encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technology-push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that the human fate is determined by a fundamental logic which is linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of the technological determinism share two general ideas. On the one hand, that the development of technology is a process that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and on the other hand, that technology itself has "impacts" on societies that are more intrinsic than socially determined.
It is possible to say that the car is a necessary part of the road development.
However, a national road network for only a small number of cars is economically not sustainable. Therefore, new production methods are developed to reduce the costs of car ownership.
The widespread ownership of cars also leads to an increase in road accidents, which in turn leads to the development of new technologies in the health sector to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a strong, cultural deterministic element, which was drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography is the thing that molded individuals. Over time, customs and cultures developed with reference to this geography and these, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
So, as Paris is now known as the fashion capital of the world, so was Constantinople the fashion capital of the empire.
His fame as the epicentre of luxury began about 400 B.C. and lasted until about 1100 AD.
His status declined in the twelfth century, mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices which were regarded as more valuable than the supply of the Byzantine markets.
At that time, too, the title of the fashion capital of the world was shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic architecture reached its peak between the 10th and 14th centuries.
At the beginning, the clothing was strongly influenced by the culture of Byzantium in the East.
Although the styles in the West are 25 to 30 years behind, they are still very much in the forefront of the fashion world.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop a distinct style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people began to use buttons to fasten their clothing as a result of the crusades.
Needs management is agriculture that is aimed at producing just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer or farmer's family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often biological farming method that uses surplus, locally available seeds and combines it with rotational farming or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
In the past, most farmers practised subsistence farming and in many developing countries this is still the case.
Subcultures bring together people who feel neglected by society's norms and enable them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be differentiated on the grounds of age, ethnicity, class, place or gender of members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as such can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual or geographical.
The members of a subculture often signal their membership by a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits and jargon.
One of the most common methods of illustrating the importance of socialization is to rely on the few unfortunate cases of children who have not been socialized by adults because of neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse during their childhood.
Wild children are called ""wild"" or wild. Some wild children have been kept captive by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, neglect was the result of the parents' inability to accept the severe intellectual or physical limitations of the child.
Wolf cubs may have suffered severe child abuse or suffered traumatic experiences before they were abandoned or escaped.
Others have been reared by animals; some have lived alone in the wild.
If it has been raised entirely by animals, the wild child displays behaviours (in the context of his physical capabilities) that are almost completely in accordance with those of his specific carer, such as his fear or indifference to people.
Project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, but scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but rather a support that helps individuals in a new learning situation, such as when they are using a new computer program or when they are starting a new project.
Arbeitsplätze können sowohl virtuell als auch real sein. Mit anderen Worten, ein Lehrer ist eine Form von Gerüst, aber auch das kleine Büroklammermännchen in Microsoft Office.
Virtual assistance is built into the software and is intended to question, suggest and explain the steps which the student may not be able to complete by himself.
Children are placed in foster homes for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion.
No child should have to grow up in a family environment which is not caring, loving and educationally oriented, but many are forced to do so.
The system of care is a piece of security for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving caregivers, a stable education and a reliable health care.
The care home should cover all the needs that they had not been able to meet in the home from which they had been removed.
The Internet connects elements of mass communication, as well as interpersonal communication.
The specific features of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the benefit- and reward-based approach.
For example, learning and socialisation are cited as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal engagement and sustained relationships were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied the audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings led to important insights into the interpretation of microexpressions, short-lived facial movements.
In particular, it is claimed that one can identify a liar by deducing the minimal changes in facial expression.
In his article The President's Speech Oliver Sacks showed how people who cannot understand language because of a brain injury can still correctly assess the honesty of people.
He even claims that the ability to interpret human behaviour may be shared with animals such as dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation results in new genetic variations and selection removes these from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with each generation in and out.
Out in the savannah it is very difficult for a primate with a digestive system like ours to meet its protein needs from available plant sources.
In addition, it has serious consequences if you do not: growth depression, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for us unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide large amounts of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
In general, it should not come as a surprise to us that our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way that chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep compensation is the process of targeted waking during normal sleep periods and the period of short sleep (10-60 minutes) later.
This can be achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without completely waking you up.
If you are someone who imagines the alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room so that you have to leave the bed to turn it off.
Another way of basing the system on the biological rhythm is to drink a lot of liquid before going to bed (especially water or tea, which is known for its urinary-tonic effect), so that you have to get up to urinate.
The degree of inner calm that a person has is inversely related to the degree of tension in the body and mind.
The lower the tension is, the more positive is the existing life force. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can attain enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded to include the path of love of the Mahayana and many techniques of the Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (awakening energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
In the centre of Tibetan meditation is the goddess yoga. Through visualising different deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are opened and the enlightened consciousness arises.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war, the collision of systems, the course and the culture led to the countries being at loggerheads.
Two years after the end of the war, the former Allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
He should last for the next 40 years and in reality be carried out by proxy armies on battlefields of Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defence was already completely broken and the only hope was in a retreat and a reorganisation along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans were however almost overnight obsolete, when over 800,000 Red Army soldiers invaded the white Russian and Ukrainian fronts and created these after they invaded into the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Yalta agreements, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is the most efficient means of transporting large human and goods volumes over the seas.
The task of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that a country is able to transport people and goods and at the same time to hinder the enemy's ability to do so.
One of the most significant recent examples is the Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans attempted to bring personnel and material to Britain to help it.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic mainly with submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Britain exactly as the rest of Europe.
It is thought that goats were domesticated in the Zagros Mountains in Iran around 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribal peoples began to keep them as livestock to get easily at their milk, fur, skin and flesh.
Sheep were usually kept in herds, wandering on hills or other pasture areas. They were cared for by shepherds, just like the more familiar sheepherders; often they were children or adolescents. This grazing system is still used today
Since the sixteenth century, engineers have built railways in England.
Although the railway tracks consisted of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses to pull the carriages faster and to carry heavier loads than on the rougher roads of the time.
In the early days, barriers were introduced to ensure the position of the railway. Gradually, however, it became apparent that railways carrying a railway track were more efficient.
This was the customary practice, but iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron railway tracks were introduced.
The first known means of locomotion was walking. The first human being to walk was the Homo erectus (which means "standing man").
Your predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk so regularly.
Two-footed species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3,9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have been walking on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to ameliorate future suffering a little.
This is in many cases merely a symptomatic treatment. If you are not only temporary solutions, then we should dig to the root of the problem and treat it.
It is really obvious that the world has changed due to the scientific and technological progress of mankind and that the problems due to overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles of people have become more serious.
After its adoption by the Congress on 4 July, a handwritten draft, signed by the Congress President John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to the printer of John Dunlap some blocks away.
In the course of the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as "Dunlap broadsides.
The first reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the Independence Hall on 8 July.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsheets that are still available are the oldest still extant copies of the document. The original handwriting has not survived the times.
Many paleontologists now believe that there is a group of dinosaurs that have survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and fly.
But many things about birds still look like dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on both hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the processing of information in binary form.
A binary number can only have one of two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, to use the computer jargon.
A poisoning can be detected only after a while. The symptoms, for example vomiting, are so general that it is not immediately possible to make a diagnosis.
The best sign of a poisoning by ingestion is the presence of an open container of medications or toxic household chemicals.
Look for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison on the label.
The term 'wabe' is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this insect group.
This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs. These are insects that are very adaptable to parasitizing humans.
Both bedbugs and fleas are nidicolous, that is, adapted to live in their nests or in the homes of their hosts.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which is the most common neurological disease in adults aged younger and middle-aged.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and the peripheral nerves.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple can decide that it is not in their own interest or in the interest of their child to raise a baby.
These couples can decide on a plan for adoption for their baby.
Adoption gives the biological parents their parental rights, so that another couple can take on the parental responsibilities.
The main aim of science is to discover how the world works. This is the basis of most scientific studies.
It is not only about experimentation, where an experiment is a test that is used to exclude or confirm one or more of the possible hypotheses.
Natural scientists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts and in particular on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were widely accepted.
With the loss of Greek language skills, Western Europe was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behaviour are often due to the presence of body-specific cycles and their production by biological clocks.
From a cycle certain behaviors are known in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators which even in absence of external signals continue to oscillate in free-swinging cycles.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the most significant evidence that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacteria.
They took two experiments, one in which they either marked the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphor or a protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the relevant piece of genetic material, and whether it is a germline cell.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cancer or death.
Natur-based tourism draws people who are interested in visiting natural areas, to enjoy the landscape, including the wild plants and animals.
Exemplary activities are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
A good example is the visit, photography and studying orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave small provincial towns with their cars to go to their workplace and are passed by others whose workplace is at the place they just left.
In this dynamic commuting, all are in some way connected to a transport system based on private cars, and support it.
Now, however, the science has shown that this massive carbon economy has brought the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has been the human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone takes part in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
You will rarely hear complaints about the water quality or the collapse of bridges in developed countries.
Why do transport systems fail so often? Why are transport engineers incompetent? Or is something fundamentally wrong going on here?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
It is a pity that it is difficult to study traffic flows, because one cannot predict driver behaviour with absolute certainty.
How fortunate it is that drivers tend to behave in a consistent manner; therefore, traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be represented mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, the three main characteristics were defined: (1) river, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of facilities on the road.
The first animals to conquer the skies were insects. Their ability to fly helped them to evade enemies more easily and to find more food and mates.
Most insects can fold their wings along their bodies.
They have a wider choice of small underwear in which they can hide themselves from thieves.
Today, butterflies and moths are the only insects that cannot fold their wings.
In the distant past, a man named Aristarch claimed that the sun was at the centre of the movements of the solar system.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite: that the solar system including the sun (and even the other stars) revolved around the earth.
I think it is sensible, because it does not seem to me that the earth is moving.
The Amazon River is the second longest and the most water-rich river in the world. It flows more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river in the world, with some stretches reaching six miles wide.
20 per cent of the water that flows through the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon basin main river is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It takes water from thousands of smaller rivers into it.
While the building of pyramids continued up to the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Gizeh were never surpassed in their size and the technical perfection of their construction.
Egyptians in the ancient New Kingdom marvelled at the monuments of their forefathers, which were then more than a thousand years old.
The Vatican City has a population of around 800 people. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language of most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used at religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known to mankind since the ancient times, since these can be found in their original form in nature and are extracted and processed with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, posited the theory that all things are made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements. It was earth, water, air and fire.
This was more in line with the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma. He also posited the theory that they would change into new substances to form what we see.
Metals are in essence a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are regarded as metals. Of course there are also other metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small quantities of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
The universe is made up of matter in its entirety. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that billions of them would fit in the point at the end of this sentence.
As a result, the pencil was invented by many people to be a good friend to them.
Unfortunately, the pencil has been supplanted by new writing methods, so that it has been pushed back into the background.
Today, people write their messages on computer screens, without ever having to touch a cursor.
I am very excited about what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The atomic bomb is based on the principle that energy is required to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like if you roll a heavy truck up a hill. When the core is split, some of this energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable cores, which means that they will break down even at the slightest provocation.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and about 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the sea and thicker under the highlands.
On the near side, there will be more Maria, as the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Theoretical approaches focus on what people are motivated by or attracted to.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are inculcated during their adulthood.
The theories deal with what certain people do to want exactly the things they want, and what influences in their environment cause them to want certain things to do or not to do.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
There are two possible behaviours when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to 'belong to the boys' (or girls) or to remain in the girls' club.
This kind of manager has problems with making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary measures, conducting performance appraisals, assigning responsibility and enforcing employee responsibilities.
At the other end of the spectrum, you become an unrecognizable individual who has to do everything differently than the team has done and takes everything for himself.
Ultimately, the manager is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behaviour often leads to friction between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are managed in the same way as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often have the function of a contact point for their immediate physical group.
They often have greater autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams can meet in different time zones that may not be taken into account by the local management.
The presence of a genuine "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also an unique feature of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the leadership team that reports to each member. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organisation undertake the time-consuming process of introducing an organisational learning concept? A target for the practical implementation of organisational learning concepts is innovation.
If all available resources are effectively used by all departments of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can arise.
In the end, the joint work of an organisation can lead to the overcoming of an obstacle to a new innovative process, to respond to customer needs.
Before an organisation can be innovative, the leadership must develop a culture of innovation and shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the concept of the continuum as a method to help organizations become more effective.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to studying cognitive processes. This limits the research field and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that various types of brain damage such as trauma, injuries and tumours can influence the behaviour and cause changes in some brain functions.
New technologies allow us to see and study certain brain structures and processes for the first time.
This provides us with many information and material to build simulation models which help us to understand the processes in our heads.
KI is not only strongly associated with science fiction, but is also a major branch of computer science concerned with behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence includes the production of machines that require intelligent behavior.
These examples include control, the setting of strategies and timetables, the ability to answer customer questions and queries, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become independent disciplines, which are focused on finding solutions for problems of the real world.
The artificial intelligence system is used today in many areas of economics, medicine, engineering and military, and is also incorporated into numerous software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of every school class. Often a teacher would like to take her students to places where a bus journey is not possible.
Virtual field trips are a technical solution. Pupils can view museum pieces, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful art works from their classroom.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design each year a website about their trip to the capital of the state. The website is updated each year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a collection album.
Blogs can also help to improve the writing skills of pupils. Although pupils at the beginning of their blog experience often have a sloppy grammar and spelling, this usually changes when there is a readership.
Students are often very critical audiences, so the blogger tries to improve his writing style to avoid criticism.
The blogging forces students to learn more about the world around them. The need to attract the audience's interest inspires students to write intelligently and interestingly.
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages pupils to continue learning outside of the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can help pupils to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet material, pupils can define their own positions in relation to texts by others and present their own perspectives on particular topics.
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital city and is home to a number of art galleries and museums that present Canada's past and present.
In the South are the Niagara Falls, and in the North the untouched beauty of nature extends to Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and other things make Ontario unique as what is regarded as typical of Canada by outsiders.
A large part of the North is sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that many surprises: There are more African Americans in the US than Canadian citizens.
The Indian Ocean islands are situated in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the biggest and, as far as the animal world is concerned, a separate continent.
The majority of the smaller islands are independent nations or attached to France and are known as luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to the country, and in the Comoros and in Mayotte it was very successful.
The European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel zone and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travellers be able to claim to be married irrespective of their actual marital status.
To wear a ring is helpful (but not a ring that looks too expensive.
Women should recognise that cultural differences can lead to what they regard as a crime, and that it is not uncommon to be beaten, handcuffed, etc.
Keep your principles firm, even if you reject men, and do not be afraid to defend them (cultural differences aside; that does not mean that it is okay!)
The modern Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the tenth century before the beginning of time. It was used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Merovingians as a strategic port with the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed them and rebuilt them under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon them after a major earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan built the city as Dar el Beida again and it was called Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
It is easy to find places in the old Medina where traditional Moroccan goods such as Tagines, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of tinned food are sold, but that is all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the extreme east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city, especially the city centre, under its feet.
While Goma is relatively safe, it is advisable to plan your stay outside Goma carefully, in order to learn about the ongoing fighting in North Kivu." #
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of the Nyiragongo volcano and for some of the cheapest gorilla tracking tours in Africa.
You can use Bodabodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The usual (local) fare is about 500 Congolese Francs for a short ride
This in combination with its relative remoteness has made "Timbuktu" a metaphor for exotic, faraway countries.
Although Timbuktu is regarded as a tourist attraction and has a airport, it is today a poor city.
In 1990, the World Heritage Committee added the desert sands to the list of World Heritage in Danger.
It was one of the most important stops on the PBS special "Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the cities of the country, because it is more Arab than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa. It borders in the east with Mozambique, in the north with Zimbabwe and in
The park has an area of 19,500 square kilometres and is divided into 14 different ecosystems, each supporting a different animal species.
He is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is regarded as the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As all South African national parks, the Kruger National Park charges daily entry fees.
It may also be worth buying a wild card that allows you to enter either selected parks in South Africa or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the namesake of the territory of Hong Kong and is the focus of many tourists.
The buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline were compared to a shimmering bar chart that is visible through the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best hope of Hong Kong, you should leave the island and drive to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
The bulk of the city formation of Hong Kong Island is concentrated along the newly acquired land along the north coast.
This is the place that the British colonists have taken over. If you look for traces of colonial history in the area, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forest in the world and extend over 80 km from the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland to the coast.
The Sundarbans were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is referred to as Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not only mangrove swamps - they also encompass some of the last remaining remnants of the mighty forest that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which 33% is covered by water and marshes.
The Sundarbans are a nature reserve since 1966, and estimates suggest that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and up to 30,000 spotted deer there.
Buses run all day long from the district-wide bus station (on the other side of the river) and most of the buses, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30 am
In Sweden, buses often fill up, so it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
Taxi collections offer a fast and comfortable way to get to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a curved cable bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and links the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guyana.
The two towers are 83 metres high, their length is 378 metres and they have two carriageways with 3,50m width.
The bridge's height is 15 meters. The construction work was completed in August 2011, but the opening for traffic was not completed until March 2017.
The bridge is to be operational by September 2017. It is expected that the Brazilian customs checkpoints will then be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group that inhabited the present-day eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters, who
The Chaco region was also the home of other indigenous groups, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering
Paraguay, formerly the province of West Indies, was formed as a result of the meeting of the Spanish conquistadors with the indigenous groups.
The Spanish began colonization, which lasted three centuries.
Since 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for its polo team and players to be among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at Las Cañitas Polo fields.
Small tournaments and competitions can be watched here at other times of the year.
Informations about competitions and ticket offices for polo are available at the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is set in accordance with the value of the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged in the only bank on the island, which is located opposite the FIC West Store.
The pound will be accepted everywhere on the islands and at Stanley credit cards. Also US dollars are often accepted.
On the remote islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, but British and American currency can be accepted; check with the owners in advance about the payment method accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland Islands' currency outside the islands themselves, so you should exchange your money before you leave the islands.
As Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer in the northern hemisphere and winter in the southern hemisphere.
Montevideo is in the subtropics. In the summer months, temperatures can reach +30 °C.
The winter can be misleadingly cold: The temperatures rarely go below freezing, but wind and moisture lead to feeling colder than what the thermometer shows.
There are no pronounced rain or drought periods: The amount of rainfall remains over the whole year in about the same.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to the sight of humans, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authority, visitors should not be within 100 yards of bears and wolves and 25 yards from all other wild animals.
Even if Bisons, Wapitis, Elches, Bears and virtually all large animals appear to be peaceful, it can still happen that they turn on each other.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not take enough space. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so leave them enough space.
Also be aware that odours attract bears and other wild animals. Avoid carrying strong-smelling foods or cooking them and be aware of a clean storage.
Apia is the capital of the island of Upolu and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 18th century and is the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a shameful stalemate in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships except one British warship were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans died.
While the Mau-Movement was organising the independence struggle, a peaceful meeting in the city led to the killing of the chief of the Mau-Movement Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III
In Auckland there are two harbours, and there are many beaches. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) lie on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Most of the beaches are sandy with safe swimming and most offer shade from Pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located at the port of Waitemata, in the upper suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
There are also family beaches, which are sometimes overcrowded, with a beautiful promenade along the coast. Swimming is here safe.
The most important local beer is "Number One". It is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is "Manta".
There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines are probably better tolerated.
Local tap water can be safely drunk, but if you are worried about it, you will also find bottled water.
For Australians, the idea of coffee ""flat white"" is foreign. A small black is ""espresso"" and a large cup of coffee is filled with foam (not with milk) and tea is served without
Hot chocolate is Belgian standard. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many trips to the reef take place all year round and injuries caused by any of these causes are rare.
However, you should follow the advice of authorities and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
Shellfish are common in the vicinity of beaches and in the vicinity of river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can also occasionally occur outside this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and would flee.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live in the sea, their primary habitat is in river mouths north of Rockhampton.
A reservation in advance gives the tourist the assurance that he will have a place to stay upon his arrival at the destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although you may also book other accommodations, such as tents, through a travel agency.
Travel agents usually offer packages in which breakfast, transport to and from the airport or even a combination of flight and hotel are included.
You can also hold your reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain further documents for your destination (e. g. a visa).
Any changes or requests should, however, be first directed to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
In some festivals, the vast majority of festivalgoers decide to camp out, and most visitors feel that this is an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you have to get there early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that on some of the festival stages, music will continue to be played until late into the night, even if the music on the main stages has stopped.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the North Sea in winter, check the position of the cabin, as breaking ice can cause quite a lot of noise for the most affected.
Cruise ships also offer time for a stay in St. Petersburg. Passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos usually try very hard to keep guests for as long as possible and to spend as much money as possible. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits are sometimes difficult to find.
They usually have a special offer of food, drinks and entertainment to keep the guests entertained and ensure that they stay.
Some casinos offer alcoholic beverages free of charge. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good players know how important it is to remain sober." #
Who wants to travel in high latitudes or over mountain passes should be prepared for snow, ice and temperatures below freezing.
On icy and snowy roads, the liability is low and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
In very short time, so much snow can fall that you can get stuck.
The visibility can also be affected by falling or drifting snow or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, cold and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic is running all year round largely uninterrupted.
Safaris are perhaps the greatest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
Safari" is a common term in the English language for a trip to Africa to see the wildlife. It is especially used in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars close, and the standard equipment enables a good view.
Lions, leopards and panthers are often shy and you can observe them better with a telescope.
A bushwalk (also known as a "bushwalk", "walking safari" or "footing") consists of a walk which may last for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held at other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Olympic Summer Games, having already hosted the 1964 Summer Olympics.
If you have booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the rescheduling announcement was made, you could find yourself in a difficult situation.
The cancellation policies vary, but most of them did not apply until the end of March, for the Olympic Games were to be held in July.
It is estimated that most tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, a typical ticket will be ¥7,000.
Washing your clothes can help drying. Many hotels provide irons and ironing boards, even if you are not present in the room.
If there is no iron available or you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer if one is available.
Don't overheat the material (it can shrink it or in extreme cases lead to burns).
There are various methods for cleaning water. Some of them are more effective than others in order to avert certain dangers.
In some areas it is enough to boil water for one minute, in others it is necessary to boil it for several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies greatly, and if you have any doubts, then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter livestock pests from their home regions that they do not know about.
Invasive species can destroy food, cause irritation or even cause allergic reactions, give poison or transmit diseases.
Infections as such or dangerous animals which can cause injury or death to humans are not normally classified as vermin.
Free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and duties at certain locations.
Travellers who have a destination country with a high taxation rate can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, particularly in the case of alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmount on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway is the most challenging driving section, as it often leads through remote, undeveloped terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: steep gradients, narrow roads and sharp bends predominate here.
The speed limits given are considerably lower than those in the previous and following sections - usually between 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and their strict compliance is even more important than usual.
However, interestingly, the mobile coverage here is much better than in many other areas of the route, for example, the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German bread is very tasty. In Bavaria, it is very rich and varied, as well as in Austria.
Obst is widely used, with apples being cooked all year round and pears and plums being used in summer.
Many German baked goods also contain nuts, almonds or other nuts. Popular cakes often fit particularly well to a cup of strong coffee.
If you wish to produce small, but rich baked goods, then try this, which is called Berliner, pancakes or crêpes in different regions.
A curry is a dish that is based on herbs and spices, with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either dry or wet depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is usually used in curries; in South India and in some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is
With a selection of 17000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a catch-all term that encompasses a great variety of regional cuisines that are found throughout the country.
When the term is used without any further attributes, it usually refers to the food that originates from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine, which is now widely spread throughout the island group, offers a variety of simple spiced dishes. As flavouring agents they prefer nuts, chilis, sugar (especially javan coconut sugar) and a range of aromatic spices.
Stitching is a kind of help for the feet of the riders, which hang down from both sides of the saddle.
They give the horse more stability, but there are security concerns because the feet of the horse may get caught in them.
If a rider falls off the horse and hooks his foot on the stirrup, he can be dragged along if the horse passes. To minimise this risk, a number of precautionary measures can be taken.
Firstly, most riders wear boots with a heel and a smooth, narrow sole.
In addition, some saddles, in particular English saddles, have safety buckles which make it possible to release the saddle from the saddle when it is pulled back by a falling rider from behind.
The Cochamó Valley - Chile's most important climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a number of large granite walls and -cliffs.
The summits offer a breathtaking view. Climbers from all over the world discover new routes along the walls, which offer endless possibilities.
Skiing and snowboarding are popular sports, in which skis or snowboards are attached to your feet and you descend a slope on a snow covered slope.
Skiing is a popular holiday activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski-penners", who plan their entire holiday around skiing at a particular place.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers go back to 5000 BC!
The origins of skiing as a sport go back at least to the 17th century and in 1861 the first ski club in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Skitouring with pack: This activity is also known as ski touring or ski walking.
It resembles alpine skiing or mountaineering, but it does not necessarily include it, because mountaineering is carried out in steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and
Look at the ski route as a comparable hiking route.
In good circumstances you can cover a greater distance than you would on a walking holiday – only very rarely will you be able to cover the speed of the cross-country skiing on well-maintained cross-country ski trails without a
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has numerous independent countries. Normally, one would have to apply for multiple visas and go through multiple passport controls if one wanted to travel through multiple countries.
The Schengen area works in this respect somewhat like a country.
So long as you remain within this zone, you can usually cross borders without having to go through the passport control again.
According to the Schengen acquis, you do not have to apply for a visa for each of the Schengen member states individually, which saves time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universally accepted definition of what constitutes an antique.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be lower in areas such as North America.
Handmade products could be described as 'antique', even though they are younger than similar products produced in mass production.
The reindeer herding is a major source of livelihood for the Sámi, and the culture around the trade is also important for many who work in other occupations.
Also, in the past, not all Sámi have bred reindeer, but have lived mainly from fishing, hunting and so on.
Today, many Sámi work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
In addition, the term ""Gypsy"" is often used by non-Roma as a derogatory term, since it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma.
If you are visiting a country that has issued you a travel warning, your travel insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can consult the advice of other governments as your own. Their advice is however aimed at their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may be confronted with other situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Conferences are merely a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views expressed are often superficial, general and oversimplified in comparison to the more detailed information that can be found elsewhere.
Weather is the umbrella term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, social disruption or loss of life.
Floods can occur anywhere in the world and there are different kinds of floods, depending on geography, topography and the atmosphere.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rains and forest fires are forms and effects of weather phenomena, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes
Regional and seasonal weather phenomena such as blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms
Travellers are strongly advised to pay attention to any type of weather that affects their area, since this may affect all their travel plans.
Anyone planning to travel to a country which is designated as a war zone should have a professional training programme in place.
A search for ""course over hostile environments"" will probably bring up the address of a local company.
A course covers all the issues discussed here in a much more detailed way, usually combined with practical experience.
A course usually lasts between 2 and 5 days and includes role-playing, lots of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
There are many books and journals on survival in the wilderness, but very few publications on conflict zones.
Travellers planning to undergo gender-switching operations abroad should be able to carry with them valid identity documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with a non-specified gender (X) or documents that have been updated to reflect the desired name and gender is different.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognise these documents is also very different.
The searches at security checks have become more intrusive in the wake of 11 September 2001.
Transgender people should not expect that their privacy and dignity will be respected when passing through the body scanners.
River currents are the return flow of broken waves, often at breakers or similar.
Because of the underwater topology, the return flow concentrates in a few deeper areas and a fast current can form there.
Many of these deaths occur when people try to swim against the current, which is impossible.
If you get out of the current, it is not difficult to get back into the current.
You should try to get somewhere where you are not caught again. Alternatively, you should wait for rescue if you are noticed. 
The shock of return is earlier than the shock of culture shock (the honeymoon phase is not as pronounced), lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travellers who found it easy to adapt to the new culture find it difficult to adapt to their own culture.
When you come back from an overseas trip, you have adapted to a different culture and have abandoned some of the behaviours of your home culture.
As you travelled abroad for the first time, people were probably patient and understanding because they knew that travellers had to adapt to a new country.
Maybe you don't expect that returning travellers should be patient and understanding.
The sound and light show at the Pyramids is one of the most interesting attractions for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and while it is still quiet before the show begins.
Normally, you hear the sounds of tourists and shopkeepers. The history of noise and light is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx is used as a background and narrator of a long history.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids, with the different pyramids being illuminated.
The Southern Shetland Islands were discovered in 1819, and they have been claimed by several countries. In 2020, there were 16 stations.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
More islands are Livingston Island and Deception, where the overflowing caldera of an active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbour.
Elsworthland is the region south of the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula go over here and rise up again to form the 360-km long chain of Ellsworth mountains, which splits off from the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak is the Mount Vinson with 4892 m height.
In remote areas without mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is not a substitute for a mobile phone, since you have to be in clear sight of a satellite to make a call.
The service is often used by ships, including pleasure boats, as well as expeditions that require data and voice telecommunications.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with further information about the connection to this service.
An increasingly popular option for people planning to take a year off is to study abroad and take courses.
This is particularly popular among university graduates, as it allows them to take a year off without affecting their studies.
In many cases, participation in a transnational mobility programme can actually improve your chances of obtaining a higher education in your home country.
In most cases, registration to these educational programmes is charged with a fee.
Finland is a great destination for boat trips. The "land of the thousand lakes" has also thousands of islands - in the lakes and in the archipelagoes." #
You do not need a yacht for the archipelagos and lakes.
In addition, even though the coastal island groups and the largest lakes are actually big enough for every boat, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is the national pastime in Finland, with one in six or eight owning a boat.
This is similar to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the ratio is one to fourty.)
Most Eastbound cruises include a longer stay in St Petersburg in Russia.
That means that you can visit the historic city for several whole days while you are on the boat and stay overnight.
If you only go on a tour of the countryside, you do not need a separate visa (Stand 2009).
Some cruises offer Berlin as a destination in Germany in their brochures. You can see on the map above that Berlin is far from the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and from all walks of life, especially if they have never flown or have had a traumatic experience behind them.
It is nothing else than the personal fears and antipathies which many people have.
To learn more about the workings of aircraft and the processes during a flight can help some people overcome their fear of the unknown or the feeling of not having control.
Courier companies are paid well for the fast delivery of things. Often, time is a very important factor in documents, trade goods or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the larger companies use their own aircraft, but on other routes and for smaller companies, difficulties arose.
If they shipped things via air freight, the loading and customs clearance could take several days on some routes.
The only way to get it done quicker was to send it as abandoned baggage. The regulations of the airline companies do not allow passengers to send luggage without one, and you come in to play.
The obvious way to fly in First or Business class is to put a wad of cash on the table (or, better still, to force your own company to pay for it).
But that is not cheap: As a rough guide, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business and the double fare for first class.
It is pointless to look for discounts on direct flights from A to B, even if you are looking for business or first class seats.
The airlines know very well that there is a certain core group of passengers who are prepared to pay a lot of money for the privilege of being able to get to their destination quickly and easily and demand appropriate prices.
The capital of Moldova is Kishinev. The native language is Romanian, but many people speak also Russian.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic, which has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
This conflict led to the formation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognised by any UN member state.
While the political negotiations have failed, economic relations between these two parts of the Republic of Moldova have been restored.
The most important religion in Moldova is the Christian Orthodox.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest harbour after Istanbul and a very good transport hub.
The once ancient city of Smyrna is today a modern, progressive and busy business centre, located on a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass buildings and modern shopping centres are shaped by classic red tiled roofs, the market from the eighteenth century, as well as old mosques and churches, although the city is more of a Mediterranean atmosphere than that of traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
On the cemetery there are some interesting marble sculptures of birds.
It is worth a half an hour to wander through the fascinating village.
In the north and close to it is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which has become known to foreigners after Lord Byron described its beauty in vivid colours.
The Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly between Cabo da Roca and Sintra.
Visit also the great shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (Pilgrimage site) – a place that is world famous for its Marian apparitions.
Please think of it as a mass grave and a place of great significance for a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who have survived here, and many others with relatives who were murdered or died working, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat this place with the respect, reverence and dignity it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Don't vandalise the site by painting or scratching graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer Catalan, the majority understand it, and almost everyone can speak Spanish.
Most of the signs are, however, only in Catalan, because it is legally declared as the first official language.
Although Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other institutions.
Normal announcements are made in the Metro only in Catalan, but unforeseen disturbances are reported by an automatic system in a variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are said to be arrogant, rude and self-centered.
Although this is often only a misleading stereotype, one finds oneself in Paris much better if one behaves like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-bred). This will make it easier to get along.
The rough exterior of Paris disappears quickly if you learn to behave properly.
The Plitwitzer Seen National Park is heavily forested, with mainly coniferous and deciduous trees and a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
He has a remarkably diverse microclimate, a diverse range of soils and altitudes, and a remarkable diversity of plant communities.
The area is also home to a very large diversity of animal and bird species.
There are rare fauna such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynxes, wild cats and wild hens, as well as many more common species.
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts that reach to the knees, and they must cover their shoulders.
In most monasteries there are no diapers for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one in bright colours, the monk or nun at the gate will smile at you.
By analogy, men should wear trousers that reach below the knees.
Also, these can be borrowed from the stock, but the clothes are not washed after every user, so you may not feel comfortable in these shirts." For men there is a uniform size!
The mallorcan cuisine is based, as in similar areas of the Mediterranean, on bread, vegetables and meat (particularly beef) and uses always olive oil.
A simple and popular evening meal, especially in the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any available ingredient such as cheese, tuna etc.
All nouns begin with a capital letter in the middle of a sentence, even if they are in the middle of a clause.
This is a useful way of distinguishing between some verbs and objects.
It makes reading easier, but writing is a little bit difficult because you have to determine whether a verb or a noun is the main word.
The Italian pronunciation is easy, because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to pay attention to are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the vowel following them.
Also, pay attention to the difference between r and rr: caro means ""love"" whereas carro means ""carriage"".
The Persian language has a relatively simple and largely regular grammar.
This book will help you learn a lot about the Persian language and to understand better the way in which the Persian language is used.
If you speak a Romance language, it is obviously easier to learn Portuguese.
People who speak Spanish could be quick to conclude that Portuguese is so similar that it is not necessary to learn it separately.
Ancient observatories are no longer in operation and are now museums or educational institutions.
The light pollution during its peak was not the problem it is today, but it was usually found in cities or on university grounds that were easier to reach than the newer ones built in recent times.
The majority of modern astronomical observatories are colossal structures in remote areas with favourable atmospheric conditions.
The viewing of the cherry blossoms, known as hanami, is a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originates from China, where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first Cherry Blossom Festivals were held by the Emperor for himself and other members of the Imperial Court.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove just one.
If you visit a formally laid out garden and collect samples, you will also be thrown out without discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to live in, and once you arrive you can almost buy anything.
You are in the extreme tropical regions and only a few degrees north of the equator, so you must be both exposed to heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, less often).
There are also a few buses that go northwards to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives
Make sure that the bus you want to take to Hebron goes there and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kirjat Arba.
Intermodal transport can be a good basis for planning your holiday.
For example, visits to castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or a cruise along the Erie Canal or a boat trip along the Thames.
They are also popular cycling and walking routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is considered to be the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with Christmas have been adopted by non-believers in both Christian and non-Christian countries.
There is a tradition to spend the night of Easter in an open place to see the sunrise.
There are of course Christian-theological explanations for this tradition, but it could also be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
Traditional churches often hold a midnight vigil on Saturday night, during the Easter weekend, when the celebrations of the congregations often begin at midnight, during which the resurrection of Christ is celebrated." #
All animals that came to the islands originally came either by swimming, flying or by swimming here.
Because of the great distance from the continent, mammals were unable to travel, which made the giant tortoise the main grazing animal on the Galapagos Islands.
From the first people to visit the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise over the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky is dark all the time.
The areas are sparsely populated and the light pollution is not a problem because it is often not a problem.
The Japanese work culture is hierarchical and formal than what Westerners might be used to.
Coats are a commonplace business attire and colleagues address each other by their family names or by their occupational titles.
Harmony at work is of paramount importance, with the focus more on group performance than individual performance.
Many employees are expected to follow the orders of their superiors without question and it is expected that they will do so.
