These new environments have different sources and different competitors, so new generations need to be stronger competitors than they were before, they need to have different facilities or fit in.
The fundamental population hasn't changed a bit, they still need the same kind of suitability.
Over time, they become less and less visible.
Finally, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations of the same species would look different, so they wouldnt be able to consider them as the same species.
We call this process as specialization, which means only new species are created. Clarification is an inevitable result and an important part of evolution.
