Yesterday, Marchetti appointed a new temporary election body (TIC) comprising nine members.
This is the fifth time the CEP Marteysi has been elected.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the previous Temporary Election Council to resign as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was a response to the mass protests against the state regime that began in October.
These sometimes accompanied by violence protests were caused by the failure to hold elections, some of which were scheduled for 2011.

Of the 1400 people surveyed in advance of the federal elections in 2010, the number of those who oppose the idea of Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent in 2008 compared to the previous year.
The acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard during the 2010 federal election campaign expressed the view that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34% of respondents share this view and want the Queen Elizabeth II to become the last monarch of Australia.
The poll also showed that 29 percent of respondents are confident that Australia should as soon as possible become a republic, while 31 percent believe that it does not need this form of government.

NextGen is a system that, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, will allow planes to fly on reduced routes and save millions of gallons of fuel, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
The system uses satellite technology instead of the old ground-based radar technology, which will allow air traffic controllers to more accurately determine the position of aircraft and give pilots more accurate information.
To Wembley is not launched additional transport, there will not be stopped on-road trains, apart from that, on the surface there are no parking and pick-up parking.
Fears of not having transport caused the assumption that the game might have to be played behind closed doors without fans.
In the description of the study published in the journal Science on Thursday, it is said that a new bird species has been discovered on the ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University (USA) and Uppsala University (Sweden) have reported that due to the mating of the endemic Eurasian sparrow-lark Geospiza darwinii with the introduced Eurasian sparrow-lark Geospiza conirostris
Gold can be molded into any shape. It can be rolled into very small shapes.
You can pull it out thin wire, which can be twisted and braided. It can be made of brass or rolled into rolls.
It can be made very thin and attached to another metal. It can be made so thin that sometimes it was used for decoration of hand-painted illustrations in books – the so-called "frontispiece".
This is called pH of the chemical substance. You can make a pH indicator by using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical substance.
The pH value is determined by the concentration of ions of hydrogen (H) in the chemical substance.
H+ ions are protons separated from electrons (hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Get a new mixture by mixing two dry powders in one container, then using clean damp hands to make a ball out of this mixture.

In almost every town of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro toilet with flush, connected to a complex sewerage system." #
These remains of the sewer systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities on the islands of Crete and Santo
The toilets were also in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, the toilets sometimes were part of public baths where men and women were washed together
When you call someone miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives a call and virtually instantaneously reflects it back down.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Astronomers use telescopes in space because the atmosphere of Earth in some way distorts our light and view." #
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, you need a huge rocket that is over 100 feet tall.
The wheel has changed the world in a way that has given us a much easier and faster transportation.
It gave us a train, a car and many other transport vehicles.
Underneath them are more cats of medium size, which eat small game from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, many small cats (including roaming domestic cats) eat and hunt on much larger animals, such as insects, slugs, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the concept of niche, a special work that each cat performs, which keeps it from competition with other cats.
Lion are the most social of all cats, living in large groups called prides.
The pride includes one to three adult males, in the same family, and females and offspring, which may be up to thirty.
The females usually live together in the same family and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lions herds behave very much like packs of wolves or dogs - animals that are so similar to lions (but not other large cats) and are also very dangerous for their victims.
Being a complete athlete, tigers can climb trees (though not very well), swim, jump over great distances and pull with five strong men.
The tiger belongs to the same family (Panthera), as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones who have the power to roar.
The tiger's roar is not like a lion's roar, but more like a babbling of nonsense.
Ocelots love to eat small animals. If an opportunity presents itself, they will chase monkeys, snakes, lizards, and birds. Almost all animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than him.
Scientists believe that wasps and bees follow the trail of animals and find their prey by smell, tracking their movements on the ground.
They are able to see in the dark with night vision and almost undetectable movement. Predators track prey, blending into the surrounding environment, and then attacking their prey.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) separates from the main population from which they originated (for example, if they cross a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment than they were previously in.
This new environment has other resources and other competitors, so the new population will need other characteristics or changes compared to those that it had before, to become a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed much — it still needs the same adaptations as before.
As time goes on, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, it will begin to look less and less like the rest of the population.
Over time, through thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will look so different that it will be impossible to say that it is the same species.
We call this process the formation of species, that is, the emergence of new species. The formation of species is an essential consequence and a very significant part of evolution.
The plants produce oxygen that the human breathes and absorb carbon dioxide that the human exhales.
Plants feed from the sun by photosynthesis. In addition, they cast shadows.
We build our houses and make clothes from plants. The vast majority of our food is plants. Without plants, animals would not have survived.
The Mosasaur was the most feared of his time, so he didn't fear anyone but other Mosasaurs.
His long jaws were adorned with more than 70 sharp teeth, and there was a second row on the roof of the mouth, so that those who met him were not saved.
We do not know for sure, but it is not out of the question that his tongue was split in two. He ate large fish, other crustaceans, and possibly even a
He also attacked all that was in water; even the giant dinosaur, such as Tyrannosaurus, could not compare with him.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their own strange and unusual dishes served at banquets. For example, the boar, the peacock, the snail and the so-called mouse.
There was another difference: while the poor people and women ate sitting on chairs, the rich people liked to have communal feasts, during which they ate, lying on their sides.
The Roman diet could not include foods that were imported from America or Asia in the following centuries.
In particular, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and no ancient Romans had ever tasted beef.
Babylonians built each of the gods a main temple, considered to be the dwelling place of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to please the gods on the ceremonies and festivals.
Each house had a covered courtyard and a sanctuary within which priests were permitted to enter.
Often, as a part of the temple, special towers were built in the form of pyramids called "pyramids".
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Near East, the house was not of great importance.
The majority of Jewish family life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; open stalls were used for construction of houses. Stone was used for construction.
On the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Scandinavian sagas, it is told that Erik the Red was expelled from Iceland for murder and, advancing further west, he opened Greenland and gave

Although each of the countries was Nordic, there were many differences between the people, rulers, traditions and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you’ve seen the movie "Treasure of the Nation", you may well think that the reverse of the Declaration of Independence depicted a map of treasure.
It is not true. Although something is written on the reverse of the document, it is not a map of the treasure.
The back side of the Declaration of Independence reads: "This Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4, 1776." The text is written in the bottom of the document and upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence this large parchment document (size 293⁄4 by 241⁄2 inches) was folded for more convenient
It's entirely possible that the entry was added just as a note.
In the operation "Neptune" and subsequent battles, the north of France was liberated, but the south of France was not yet liberated.
He was under the control of the "Vichy" French. These French, who signed a peace treaty with the Germans in 1940, worked together with the occupiers instead of fighting them.
On August 15th, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France. The invasion was called "Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks the Free French and the Americans liberated southern France and went to Germany.
Civilization is an individual culture, the culture of a large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word 'civilization' comes from the latin 'civis', which means 'citizen' and is related to the latin words civis, meaning 'citizen', and civitas, meaning 'city' or 'city-state
Cities-states are the precursors of nations. Civilizational culture means the transmission of knowledge through several generations, continuous cultural presence and transferable cultural legacy.
Small cultures are often lost, leaving no historical evidence, and so cannot be recognised as authentic civilizations.
In the War of Independence, thirteen states, in accordance with Articles of Confederation, first formed a weak central government, the only body of which was the Congress.
The Congress had no authority to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial power, it relied on the powers of the states, which often refused to cooperate and did not enforce its acts.
He also did not have the authority to abolish tax legislation and rates of the states.
To amend these articles requires unanimous approval of all states, but the states have been so irresponsible to the central government that their representatives seldom attended.
Italian national football team, along with German, is the second most successful team in the world and won the World Cup in 2006.

Winter sports are most popular in northern regions. Residents of Italy from these regions take part in international competitions and Olympiads.
In Japan there are 7000 islands (the largest of which is Hokkaido), which makes Japan the seventh largest island in the world!
Japan is often referred to as an archipelago because it is part of a cluster of islands.
Taiwan takes its name from a long time ago, in the XV century, when European sailors, passing by, recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base on the southwest of Taiwan, initiating the transformation of the native methods of grain production and hiring Chinese workers to work on their rice and
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after the defeat in China-Japan War (1894-1895), the Chinese government signed the Sino-Japanese Treaty, which gave Japan the right to rule Taiwan until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main structures, namely the Inca Temple of the Sun, the Temple of the Three Windows and the Inca Temple of the Moon.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex were renovated to give foreign nationals a better idea of how they looked originally.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu was restored. Restoration works continue to this day.
For example, the most common format for static photos is 35 mm, and this was the dominant size of film on the aperture of analogue era.
It is still made, but more important is that the aspect ratio of the images in digital cameras is inherited.
The 35mm format is a bit confusing, it has a width of 36 mm and a height of 24 mm.
The aspect ratio of this format is divided into twelve, so it is called 3:2.
Many common formats (like the APS family of formats) are close or equal to these proportions.
Too often used and often mocked as a rule of thirds — it is a simple recommendation that creates dynamism while preserving a certain amount of order in
It says that the best place to place the main object is on the intersection of lines that divide the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see the
In this period of European history, the Catholic Church, becoming rich and powerful, was the object of intense scrutiny.
Christianity has united Europe for more than a thousand years despite the differences in languages and traditions.
Her omnipresent power touched everyone - from the king to the common man.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to ease suffering and poverty, and that the church’s money exists just for this purpose.
The center of the church's authority was based in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth led to many doubting whether this dogma was being observed.
In a short time after the start of the war, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
This strategy has proven its effectiveness, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated all-around international law, set forth in several international agreements over the past two centuries." #
Britain has detonated international waters, so that ships can not enter whole sectors of the oceans, putting at risk even neutral ships.
Because of the cautious reaction to this tactic, Germany expected such a reaction on its unhindered submarine operations.
In the 1920s, among the majority of the people and nations, there were such feelings as pacifism and isolation.
By learning about the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, states wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America, and accepted a position at the company Edison in the city of New York.
He came to the United States with four cents in his pocket, a poem, and a recommendation letter from Charles Batchelder, who was his boss at the previous job, to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, they used a unique way to indicate periods of time; each stage of China or each family in power was a special dynasty.
In addition, there was a period of three kingdoms during each dynasty, which lasted for 60 years during the Han and Qing dynasties.
In this period there were fierce wars between many nobles, fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting for the throne in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.
There are a variety of social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people
As well as after the Revolution, opportunities opened up for all men, which allowed the most ambitious and talented to achieve success.
The same applies to the army, because ranks were based on qualities, not on origin.
The French Revolution also inspired many other political prisoners in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in topics that were not related to the worldly life. He often visited the cave known as Hira on Mount "Nûr" (light) to contemplate
And the cave which is well-preserved to our days, very vividly tells us about the spiritual aspirations of Muhammad.
The cave is located on the top of the mountain to the north of Mecca and completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It is very difficult to detect even to those who know of its existence. In the cave, the man is isolated from the world.
There is nothing but pure beautiful sky above your head and a multitude of surrounding mountains. From the depths of the cave you can see and hear only a very small part of this world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century BC and is one of many great pyramidal structures built to honor the memory of the Pharaoh.
The Great Pyramid of Giza, or the Pyramid of Khufu, in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, includes several pyramids (including the Great Pyramid of Giza), several small tombs, several temples and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honour of the Pharaoh Haps, and many smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honour of his wives and his relatives.
The movement of the screw sign looks like V, and the movement of the square without a bottom looks like a screw or a square without a bottom.
Up" means that you should start with the tip of your finger and move your bow forward, and "down" means that you should start with where your hand holds the bow and move it back.
The upward motion of the bridge produces a softer sound, while the downward motion produces a stronger and more forceful sound.
You can draw your own brush strokes, but remember that the brush strokes are printed for musical reasons, and they usually have to be followed.
On October 6, 1789, angry crowds of women from the market forced the return of the King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two small children (11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and sister of the King Madame
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted threats to the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to widen the windows.
At some point one of the crowd waved his hand to the king's guard, who was killed in Versailles on the eyes of the terrified queen.
The American imperialist military expenditures on the Philippines paid for themselves by the Filipinos.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to pay for the large part of the expenses and the interest on the bonds transferred by the government of the Philippines through banks in Wall
Of course, the profits derived from the long exploitation of the Filipinos were the main source of income for American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one needs to understand the context in which they were created.
The period in which these events took place is called the High Middle Ages, a period of European history that covers the period from 1000 to 1300 years (1000–1300 years B.C.
High Middle Ages replaced earlier Middle Ages and preceded the later Middle Ages, which, according to the accepted view, ended around 1500.
Technological determinism - is a term, covering a wide range of practical ideas, from technical progress or technological imperative to strict point of view, that fates people are driven by the fundamental logic, associated with laws of science and their manifestation
A majority of views on technological determinism share two common ideas: that the direction of technological development is virtually uncontrollable by cultural or political influences and that, in turn, "influence" of technologies on society is determined by their own properties
For example, you could say that the car is the essential cause of the development of roads.
But the national road network is economically unfeasible for only a small group of vehicles, so new methods of production are being developed to reduce the cost of ownership of the vehicle.
Mass ownership of cars also results in an increase in the number of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new methods of treating injuries received on the road.
Romanticism was a major component of cultural determinism, drawn from such writers as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography formed people, and over time, there developed associated with it customs and culture, which, in harmony with the place of residence of the society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Like Paris is the capital of fashion in the modern world, so Constantinople was the capital of fashion in the times of feudal Europe.
His fame as a center of luxury spread about 400 B.C. and continued for about a thousand years.
His status was declining during the 12th century mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with such gifts as silk and spices, which were more valuable than those offered on the Byzantine
At this moment and the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and the 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, clothing was under the strong influence of Byzantine culture on the east.
But because of slow communication channels, Western styles may lag behind by 25-30 years.
Own styles began to develop in Western Europe at the end of the Middle Ages. One of the biggest achievements of that time, thanks to the Crusades, was the use of buttons to fast
Natural agriculture is agriculture that is conducted to produce enough food for the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Natural farming is a simple, often organic, system of agriculture, using seeds from the ecosystem in which they grow, along with the use of rotational and other relatively simple methods of increasing yield.
Historically, most farmers have been engaged in agriculture for the purpose of sustenance, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded people who feel marginalised by the standards of society and allow them to define themselves.
There are differences between subcultures, due to age, nationality, social status, place of residence and/or sexual orientation of the people from which it is composed.
The characteristics that define a subculture as an individual entity may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
A representative of a particular subculture often claim their membership through a symbolic and distinctive use of style, including through fashion, manners and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to illustrate several unfortunate cases when children were not properly cared for, unfortunate circumstances or intentional cruelty caused them to not interact with adults during their adulthood.
These children are called "wild" or "unruly". Some wild children were isolated by people (usually their own parents). In some cases, such an abandonment of their child was the result of the parents' re
Children living on the streets, it is possible that they have suffered from severe forms of violence or trauma before escaping or being abandoned.
Others, as is claimed, were raised by animals; some of them lived in the wild on their own.
If he has been raised by animals instead of people, a wild child displays the same traits (in the physical limits) as the specific animal that raised him — for example, his fear or indifference to people.
While learning on the basis of projects should be more simple and interesting, spooning out ahead of many technologies.
Scaffling is not a method of teaching, but rather a form of help to those who are going through a new experience of learning, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffling can be either virtual or real. In other words, the teacher is a form of scaffling, but also she is the Sticky Note in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding, helping in learning, is embedded in the software and is intended to remind, explain and ask questions about procedures that the learner, perhaps, would be too difficult to cope with on his own.
Children are transferred to foster care for a variety of reasons: from being abandoned to being abused and even extorted." #
Children should not grow up in a situation where they are not provided with care, education and training, but grow.
We consider the foster care system safe for children.
Our child welfare system should provide safe housing, loving parents, stable education, and reliable health care.
Patronage education should provide all the needs that were lacking in the house where they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional scales in terms of approach to use and satisfaction.
Thus, it has been suggested that "learning" and "socialization" are important motivating factors for using the Internet (James et al
Personal involvement" and "long-term relationships" were also named by Eames and McCord (1998) as new dimensions of motivation when they studied how people react to Web sites
The use of video recording led to important discoveries in the field of interpretation of microexpressions — movements of the face for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to determine whether the person lies, by correctly interpreting his microexpressions.
In the article "The President's Speech" Oliver Sacks described how people who have suffered brain damage can not understand speech, but can properly assess the sincerity of the
According to his theory, such abilities may be possessed by animals, for example, domestic dogs.
The research conducted in the twentieth century showed that there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation introduces a new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the set of manifested variations.
Segregation and recombination with each generation, rearrange the variations between two pools.
In the savanna, the primates with such a digestive system as that of man, are difficult to meet their nutritional needs by the available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so will have serious consequences, such as slow growth, malnutrition, and, in the end, death.
The most accessible plant resources would be proteins found in leaves and legumes, but they are poorly absorbed by such rodents as we, if they are not prepared.
In contrast, animal-derived food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest but also represents a rich source of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
In the light of all that has been said above, one should not be surprised that our ancestors decided to "protein" the problem in a similar way as it is solved by chimp
Sleep interruption is a process of intentional awakening during the normal sleep and subsequent re-sleeping within a short time (10–60 minutes).
It can be done quite easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up and still not wake you up completely.
If you find out that you are resetting your alarm clock while you are sleeping, you can set it on another side of the room so that you will have to get up to turn it off
Other options based on biological rhythms include drinking large amounts of water (for example, water or tea known as a diuretic) before bedtime, which forces the person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace of a person is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in his body and soul.
When the battery voltage is lower than 4.8V, the life-force is more positive. Everyone has the potential to attain absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negative attitude.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has been supplemented by the Mahayana path of love and a number of techniques of Indian yoga.
The principle of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of unconditional love.
Energy of Kundalini (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
The Heart of Tibetan Meditation is Yoga of the Deities. By visualizing various Deities, the channels are cleansed, the chakras are opened and the consciousness is enlightened.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. After the war, the differences between the system, process and culture led to discord between countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
She had to last for the next 40 years. In it, they fought in a real way, using indirect armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba and many other places in the world.
By September, 1939, the Polish defence had been breached, and the only hope was retreat and reorganization along the Romanian front.
However, these plans became obsolete practically overnight, when around 800 000 Soviet Red Army soldiers formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian Fronts after the seizure of the Eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Agreement, the Soviet-Polish Pact of Non-Aggression, and other
The use of ships for the transportation of goods is, of course, the most effective way of transporting a large number of people and goods across oceans.
The traditional work of sailors is to ensure the country’s ability to move its people and goods, as well as to prevent the enemy’s ability to move its people and goods.
One of the most interesting recent examples of this was the company in the North Atlantic during World War II. Americans tried to transport people and materials through the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly its submarines, tried to stop this movement.
If the anti-Hitler coalition had failed, Germany, I think, could have won Britain as well as other European countries.
Early domestication of cattle is believed to have occurred in the Zagros Mountains about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to leave them to have milk, wool, meat and skin on hand.
Home goats are commonly kept in herds, which wandered over hills or other pastures, where often watched by shepherds, who were usually children or teenagers, which looks like a more common activity of a shepherd.
Roads for carriages were built in England in the 16th century.
While the wagon roads were merely laid parallel to the boards of wood, they gave horses the opportunity to transport larger loads and at a higher rate of speed than on slightly more bumpy roads at the time.
Slabs were first used quite a long time ago to hold rails in place. However, it became clear that the tracks were more effective when laid with iron on top.
It is now a common practice, but iron led to more wear on wooden wheels on wagons.
As time went by, wooden wheels were replaced by iron. In 1767, the first rails were made entirely of iron.
The first known form of transportation was walking, people began walking straight two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning the straight man).
For their ancestors of the Australopithecines, standing upright was not so natural.
Bipedal specializations are found in the remains of australopithecines from the period of 4,2-3,9 million years ago, although, perhaps, the sahelanthropus walked on
We can start living more consciously about the environment. We can become members of the environmental movement and even be activists to help at least a little ease the suffering of the future." #
This is often like treating the symptoms. If we need a temporary fix, we need to find the root cause and fix it.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed greatly due to the scientific and technological progress of humanity, and because of the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of people, the problems have
After the Congress of 4 July, the manuscript draft, signed by the Chairman of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson, was sent out in a few quarters to the printing shop of
In the night 150–200 copies were made known as "Dunlop leaflets.
The first public reading of this document was made by John Nixon in the Independence Hall on July 8th.
June 6th, one copy was sent to George Washington, who 9 July ordered it read before his troops in New York. The copy arrived in London 10 August.
25 leaflets of Danley, known to the present day, are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript copy has not reached us.
Many paleontologists now believe that one of the dinosaur groups survived and lived to our day. We call them birds.
Often they are not considered as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and can fly.
But you can still say a lot about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have claws with scales and claws, they lay eggs and walk on two hind legs like a tiger.
Almost all computers that are used today are based on information processing that is encoded in binary.
A binary number can have only one of two values, that is, 0 or 1. These numbers are called "binary digits" — or "bits", if you use computer-speak
It can be difficult to diagnose a acute oral poisoning right away. Such symptoms, such as vomiting, are common for a quick diagnosis.
The best sign of an internal poisoning is the presence of an open container of medicine or a toxic household chemical.
Read the label, where you will find special instructions on first aid in case of poisoning by this specific poison.
The term ‘bug’ is used by entomologists formally to refer to a group of insects.
This concept comes from the ancient times of bed bugs - insects, well adapted to parasitism on man.
And predators, and bed bugs are nest-building species, adapted to life in the nest or home of their owner.
In the United States, approximately 400 thousand cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) are diagnosed each year, making MS the leading neurological disease among young
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, consisting of the brain, spinal cord and the optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to suffer from MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or the best interests of their child.
Couples can choose to create a plan for adoption for their child.
In adoption or foster care, biological parents refuse to their parental rights in order to give another couple the opportunity to take the child.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world works, by applying the scientific method. This method is the basis of most scientific research.
However, he is not the only one. Scientific research also follows experimentation (experimentation is a test used to exclude one or more possible hypotheses), asking questions and conducting observations.
Naturalist and philosophers focused their attention on anti-Christian texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
In all scientific questions, including psychology, Aristotle's views were adopted.
As the Greek language deteriorated, Western civilization was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often in significant part dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, not just a response to external periodic stimuli, have been recorded in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to autonomous oscillations for a period of time even without external stimuli.
The experiment of Hershey and Chase was one of the first hypotheses that DNA is genetic material.
The Hershey's Kisses with Chase's DNA were implanted into the bacteria with the help of phages, i.e. viruses.
They performed two experiments, labeling the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus and radioactive iodine, respectively.
Mutations can cause a large number of diverse results depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the mutated segment of the genetic material and whether the mutated cells are embryonic stem cells.
Only mutations in the germline can be passed on to the next generation, while mutations somewhere else may lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism is interesting for those who love to travel to the countryside to enjoy the landscape, including wild animals and plants.
In the list of activities available at the hotel - hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
An example could be the visit, photography and study of orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave small towns in rural areas to go to work, and by their side pass those whose place of work is located in the place from which they just left.
In this active transportation movement, each is somehow connected to the transportation system based on personal cars, and supports it.
In the present day science indicates that the enormous oil economy has had an impact on one of the stable states of the biosphere, which has supported evolution for the past two million years." #
Everyone is a member of society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about these systems.
You rarely hear such complaints about the quality of water or falling bridges in developed countries.
Why do the transport systems get so many complaints, why do they break down every day? Is it just incompetence? Or do there have more fundamental reasons?
The study of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction with each other is carried out within the framework of the study of traffic flows.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the intensity of traffic, because it is not possible to predict the behavior of the driver.
Fortunately, drivers' behavior is often quite consistent; thus, traffic flows generally have some consistency and can be approximated mathematically.
To better represent the transport stream, were established relationships between three main variables: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relations help in planning, designing and operating railway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to rise in the air. Their ability to fly helped them to slip away from enemies, find food and partners.
Many insects have the ability to fold their wings along the body, which gives them an advantage.
This provides them with more secluded places where they can hide from predators.
Spiders and flies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Many thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
It seems reasonable to me, because we don’t feel that the Earth is moving, do you?
The Amazon River is the second longest river in the world and the first largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, its width sometimes exceeding six miles.
20 percent of the water that flows from rivers on our planet into the oceans flows from the Amazon.
The main river of the Amazon has a length of 6387 km (3980 miles). It flows into thousands of small rivers.
However, despite the fact that the construction of the pyramids of stones continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical perfection of the pyramids at Giza have never been surpass
In the new kingdom of ancient Egyptians were amazed by monuments created by their predecessors more than a thousand years ago.
Population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and also the country with the smallest population.
In the Vatican, Italian is used in legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language for most people working in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Catholics.
People have known the basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver and copper, since they can be found in nature in pure form and relatively easily mined with primitive tools.
Aristotle believed that all things are composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. It was earth, water, air, and fire.
They were like four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, though he also suspected that they would transition into a new state, to get what we see.
Composites are mixtures of two or more metals. Remember that in the periodic table there are many elements.
These elements, such as calcium and potassium, are considered metals. Of course, there are also such metals as silver and gold.
You can also make such alloys that contain a small amount of such nonmetallic elements as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter consists of minute particles, known as atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them can fit in the end of this sentence.
So, the pencil became a good friend for many people when it was invented.
It is sad that when new ways of writing appeared, pencil lost its former status and they are less used.
Now they write messages on screens, and they never have to deal with a pencil.
It's only a matter of time before the keyboard dies out, with the advent of more new technologies.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that for a large number of protons and neutrons to be in one nucleus, energy is required
Like pushing a heavy trolley up a hill. Then the splitting of the nucleus releases some of this energy.
Some atoms have a volatile nucleus, which means that they are prone to decay under little or no influence." #
The Moon's surface consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km under the oceans and 100 km under the continents.
It’s thinner under the moon seas and thicker under the mountains.
On the visible side there are more moon seas because the crust is thinner there. The waves were easier to rise to
Content theories focus on the search for what makes people act or might be of interest.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that accumulate within during their lifetime.
These theories concern what makes people want to do what they do, and what makes them do or not do certain things in their environment.
Two popular theories of content are the "Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs" and the "Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory of Motivation.
As a rule, two types of behavior can be observed when managers start to manage people, previously equal to them in status. One extreme spectrum is the attempt to remain "one's man" (or
Those managers are difficult to take unpopular decisions, disciplinary measures, evaluate the results of work, distribute responsibilities and hold workers accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, a person becomes an unrecognizable individual, who feels he must change everything that the team did and take it over.
Because the leader ultimately bears responsibility for the success or failure of the team.
This kind of behavior often leads to conflicts between leaders and other team members.
Virtual commands follow the same standards of skill as the built-in commands, but there are some minor differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their direct physical group.
They are usually more autonomous than traditional teams, because their teams can meet at different time zones, which is not always understandable by local management.
The presence of a genuine invisible team (LaRosa and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also unique to virtual teams.
The invisible team" is a team of managers that reports to each participant. The invisible team sets standards for each participant.
Why should organizations go through the tedious process of creating self-learning organizations? One of the purposes of applying the concepts of self-learning organizations in practice is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively used across all functional departments of an organization, creativity and inventiveness can be manifested.
In the end, a united effort by the organization to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovative process that will be in the client's interest.
Before an organization can become innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation, knowledge-sharing and experience-gathering.
Engel (2006) explains the approach "Continuum" as a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of effectiveness.
The data from neurobiology give physical evidence for the theoretical approach to studying consciousness. Thus, the field of study is narrowed, and it becomes much more accurate.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior is used by scientists in their studies.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, injuries, traumas, lesions and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The introduction of new technologies allows us to see and explore unseen structures and processes in your brain.
This provides us with a large amount of data and materials for creating and simulating models that help us understand the processes taking place in our consciousness.
Despite the fact that AI is firmly associated with science fiction, it forms a very important area of computer science, which considers the behavior and learning of machines and "instilling
AI research includes the creation of intelligent machines for automating tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
Here are some of the examples that you can use: control, planning, and creating a schedule, responding to diagnoses and questions from the customer, and recognizing face, handwriting, and voice.
These issues are delineated in separate disciplines, the purpose of which is to address the problems we face in everyday life.
The AI system is increasingly used in economics, medicine, engineering and military fields, being embedded in some software applications for home computers and video games.
Study tours are very important for any class. Sometimes teachers want to take their students there, where buses cannot go.
The technology provides a solution by using virtual tours. Students can view museum exhibits, visit the aquarium or enjoy fine art, sitting with their class.
Updating the tour online for public viewing is also a great way to refresh your memory of the tour and share your knowledge with future classes.
For example, every year students at Bennet High School in South Carolina create a website about their visit to the capital of the state, and each year that site is updated, but access to old versions is still preserved — they serve as
Blogs can also improve writing skills. Although students often start their blog using sloppy grammar and spelling, it usually changes as a result of the presence of an audience.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to strive to improve his or her letter in order to avoid criticism.
Others, writing a blog, "students begin to understand the world around them." Students are inspired to be smart and interesting, drawing attention to themselves (Toto, 2004).
Bloggership is an instrument that stimulates cooperation and it motivates students to spread the process of acquiring knowledge far beyond the traditional school day.
Using blogs can give students the opportunity to become more analytical and critical. By actively responding to internet-based materials, students can determine their position in the context of other students' work, as well as express their own views on specific questions (O'Re
Ottawa is a delightful bilingual capital of Canada with a large number of art galleries and museums that open up the past and present of Canada.
Next to the south Niagara Falls, and the north is the domain of untouched natural beauty Muskoka and surrounding areas.
All of this and more makes Ontario something truly Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
The larger areas further north are seldom settled, and some of them are almost uninhabited wilderness.
Astonishing comparison of the number of people: in the United States more blacks than Canadians.
East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean near the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is much more than other countries and is a unique continent in that respect.
Almost all of the smaller islands are independent states or associated with France and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to this region, especially it has been established on the Comoros and Mayotte.
The spread of European influence and colonization began in the 14th century, when Vasco da Gama discovered the way through the Cape of Good Hope from Europe to India.
North of the region is Sahel, on the south and west - the Atlantic Ocean.
For women: all tourists are advised to say that they are married, regardless of their current marital status.
Also useful to wear a ring (not too expensive to look at).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can make them feel harassed, women are often pursued, grabbed by the hand and so on.
Stand firmly for men and don't be afraid to stand up for your own (this is not acceptable irrespective of cultural differences).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berbers in the X century BC. It was used by Romans, Phoenicians and Meroeans as a strategic port, called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as the Castle of Kazan-Branka, but left it after the earthquake of 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city of Ed-Dard-el-Beida, and the Spanish traders who founded here trading bases, called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all Morocco.
Around the old medina you can find places where you can buy such traditional Moroccan goods as tajine, pottery, leather goods, cigarettes and a whole range of trinkets, but all of
Goma is a tourist town on the Democratic Republic of Congo's eastern border, with Rwanda.
In 2002 the city of Goma was destroyed by lava from the volcano Niragongo, which buried under its streets, especially the central part of the city.
Although Goma is a relatively safe place, it is best to check with the local authorities before traveling outside of Goma to understand the status of the ongoing fighting in the North Kivu province.
This city is also the starting point for climbing the volcano Niragongo, as well as you can see the mountain gorillas in the wild at one of the cheapest prices in Africa.
You can ride a Goma-Goma (motorbike taxi) for a short ride. The normal fare is 500 CFA francs for a short ride.
Because of its remoteness, Timbuktu has become a metaphor for an exotic faraway land.
Today Tombuctu is a poor city, but its reputation attracts tourists, and there is an airport there.
In 1990, the site was added to the World Heritage List, threatened by desert sands.
When filming the PBS program "African Wonders" on the channel, one of the most important stops was made here.
This city is very different from the rest of the country, because it is dominated by the Arabian flavor, not the African.

You can exchange money in one bank on these islands, which is located on Port Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
For most of the islands, British pounds are accepted everywhere. In Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also accepted.
Credit cards are not accepted on remote islands.
The Falkland Islands currency is almost impossible to exchange outside the islands, so exchange your money before you leave.
Because Montevideo is located south of the equator, there is summer when in the Northern hemisphere winter, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the tropics. In summer months, the temperature of the air above +30°C is a common occurrence.
Winter can be misleadingly cold: temperatures rarely fall below zero, but the combination of wind and humidity creates the feeling of a colder weather than what the thermometer shows.
There is no particularly "wet" and "dry" seasons: the amount of precipitation is approximately the same all year.
Although many animals in the park get used to seeing people, nature is still wild, so it is not necessary to feed or disturb the animals.
The park administration warns: do not approach more than 100 yards/meters to bears and wolves, and more than 25 yards/meters to all other wild animals!
No matter how submissive they look, - buffaloes, deer, bears and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they do not respect the personal space of these animals. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so respect their personal space.
In addition, remember that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid cooking or wearing with you smelly food, as well as maintaining cleanliness in the camp.

When the weather is bad enough for snow to fall, it can fall in a very short amount of time.
The visibility may also be limited due to snowfall, fog, condensation or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, weather conditions with snow and ice are normal in many countries, and the traffic continues almost year round without breaks.
Safari - probably the biggest lure for tourists in Africa and the main event for many travelers.
The term "safari" in everyday use means a land trip with the purpose of seeing the astonishing wildlife of Africa, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants or giraffes, often approach cars, so that with ordinary equipment you can get a good view.
Leopards, cheetahs and lions sometimes are shy, and you will see them better through a binocular.
Walking safari (also called "tree-hunting", "hiking-safari" or "walking tour") consists of a walk lasting from a few hours to several days.

In some places, it is enough to boil water for a minute, in other places it will take a few minutes.
Filters are effective in different ways, and in the event of doubts, you should think about buying water in sealed bottles and from a reputable company
Travelers can come face-to-face with pests they have never seen in their home country.
Predators can ruin food, cause irritation or, even worse, cause allergic reactions, release toxins or transmit infection.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals, which can cause damage or death to humans, are usually not considered pests.
Shopping "duty-free" is an opportunity to buy certain items at certain points without taxes and duties.
Travellers heading to countries with high taxation rates can sometimes save a significant amount, especially on such items as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fermont has the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often passing through isolated, dark and forested countryside
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be on your guard: there are steep slopes, narrow lanes and sharp turns.
The speed limits are much lower than those on previous and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km / h) - and strict compliance with them is even more important
However, as strange as it may seem, mobile phone service here is much better than on many other sections of the route, for example in Pennsylvania, Wyoming.
German bakery cakes are quite good. In Bavaria they are very abundant and diverse and look like cakes from their southern neighbor, Austria.
