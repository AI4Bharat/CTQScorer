This confirms not only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides details that fossils in general cannot provide, such as colour and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this bird were both on the top and on the bottom of the brown and the carotinoid-coloured.
The find also gives us insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well developed sheath called the quill, but other characteristics of feathers – hooks and barbules – the researchers concluded that the quill probably was an evolutionarily later development than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or for the heartbeat.
The scientists claimed that this is the tail of a young dinosaur, but the sample shows no feathers of an adult and no crested duck.

In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and insert a pre-printed sheet of paper, on which the candidate of their choice is listed, into a sealed envelope.
After the officials have confirmed the identity of the voter, the voter throws the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.

Candidates may send representatives to attend any stage of the process, including the evening vote. Voting will be carried out under strict supervision and in accordance with special procedures.

The police chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused were present in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were in the house when the car drove into it, none of them were injured.
The driver suffered considerable head injuries.
The road, on which the accident occurred, was temporarily closed while the rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was transferred to the Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was charged in the meantime before the Edinburgh Sheriff Court for murdering her son.
She is currently in detention awaiting trial, but eyewitness statements could be exaggerated because of the widespread publication of her photograph.
This is standard practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but the Scottish judiciary works differently, and the courts have found the publication of photographs as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee remarks: "Journalists seem to be crossing a dangerous line when they publish photographs etc. of suspects.
The Crown Office, which is responsible for prosecuting, has indicated that at least until the prosecution no further comments will be made.
According to a leak, the document refers to the border dispute in which Palestinians demand a reversal of the borders in the state of Israel in 1967.
Other topics, which are supposedly covered, include the future of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the Jordan Valley.
Israel wants a military presence in the Jordan Valley for ten years from the signing of the agreement, the Palestinian Authority on the other hand wants a five-year presence only.
The shooters of the accompanying experiment to control the plague should be closely supervised by rangers, as the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness was evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited to assist with the shooting program of the Sporting Shooters Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the director of Park Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the four selected hunters received comprehensive security and training training.
Martelly has just appointed a provisional Electoral Commission (CEP) with nine members.
It is his fifth CEP within four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of the measures package to steer the country towards new elections.
The Commission was the response to the widespread regime-critical protests that began in October.
The trigger for the sometimes violent protests was the failure to hold elections, some of which are due to be held in 2011.
Over 60 cases of overheating of iPods have been reported. In total six fires have been set and four people have suffered minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that it had 27 accidents in connection with the devices.
Last week, the METI announced that it had received 34 additional reports of overheating from Apple, which it described as "not serious
The Ministry responded by describing the Apple move as "really regrettable.
The earthquake shook Mariana at 07:19 p.m. local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Office of Disaster Management in the northern Marians said that no damages have been reported in the country.
Also, there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer kidnapped tourists from Hong Kong by forcing their bus into Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot with his M16 rifle at the tourists.
At least six confirmed dead have been rescued and there are at least six confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including the children and the elderly, were released, as well as the Filipino photographers.
The photographers took up the space of an elderly lady as she had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot." #
Liggins followed in the footsteps of his father and became a medical doctor.
He was trained as a maternity doctor and took up his post at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working in the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature contractions in his spare time.
His research showed that the application of a hormone accelerated the lung development of the fetus.
Xinhua reported that investigators from the government on Wednesday recovered two "black box" flight recorders.
Ringer colleagues paid tribute to Luna as well.
Tommy Dreamer said: ""Luna was the first queen of extremes. My first manager. Luna died in the night of the two moons. Very unique, exactly like she. A strong woman.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels gave the following comment: "Luna was just as crazy as I was... maybe even crazier... I love her and I will miss her... hopefully she is in a better place.
Of the 1,400 people who were surveyed in 2010 prior to the federal elections, the proportion of those who opposed Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The present incumbent Prime Minister Julia Gillard during the election campaign for the federal election in 2010 said that her opinion was that Australia would end up being a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 per cent of respondents share this view and wish that Elizabeth II is the last Australian monarch.
29 percent of the respondents said Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent of the respondents said Australia should never become a republic.
The gold medal winner at the Olympic Games should swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three-layer heats, but because of his many complaints his fitness was doubted.
He was not able to take the necessary medication to overcome his pain as they are banned at the Commonwealth Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Many people confirmed the discovery via different hardware and software on February 9th and on Tuesday the news was announced.
Cosmic dust may have been a source of water supply for the earth, together with organic matter that forms proteins and allows life.
The scientists are hoping to gain insights into how planets, in particular the Earth, are formed.
Cuomo (53) took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He described the rumours as "political nonsense and idle chatter.
There is speculation that he may be applying for the Presidency of the Council in 2016.
NextGen is a system claimed by the FAA that would allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce carbon emissions.
It is using satellite-based technology rather than the older technology based on ground radar to enable the air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport facilities are to be set up and the underground trains will not stop at Wembley. There are no parking or parking-and-ride facilities available at the site.
With the fear of not having enough transport facilities, the probability grew that the game would be played behind closed doors.
A study published on Thursday in Science reported the emergence of a new bird species on the Galápagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and the Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species had developed within two generations, despite the previous assumption that the process took much longer due to the mating between a native Darwin's gull, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant Kaktusfink, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be rolled into various forms.
It can be made into a thin thread that can be twisted and woven into a rope. It can be hammered or rolled into leaves.
It can be made so thin that it sometimes became a substitute for paintings, called picture books, to decorate them with picture books called picture books.
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You can make a red dye with vinegar.
The ash changes its colour depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH level points to the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemicals.
Protons are electrons that have been removed from water molecules (because hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two powders together and then form them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a protective layer.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet in almost every house that was connected to a complex sewage system.
Remains of wastewater systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia and China, there were toilets. In the Roman culture, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, which men and women visited together.
If you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back down almost immediately.
The satellite was launched by a rocket into space. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and our view.
It is necessary for a gigantic rocket to reach a height of more than 100 feet to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest service it has given us is much easier and faster transportation.
It has brought us the railway, the car and many other means of transport.
In addition to the medium-sized cats, there are medium-sized cats that eat prey of all sizes, from rabbits to elephants and rhinoceroses.
Finally, there are still many small cats (including free-roaming domestic cats) that eat much smaller prey such as insects, rodents, snakes and birds.
The secret of their success is the niche concept, a special task that every cat has and that ensures that they do not compete with other cats.
Lions are the most social cats. They live in large groups, which are called clans.
The herds consist of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and young males.
Women usually have a close relationship with each other, if they live in a large family with sisters and daughters.
Lions are similar to wolves and dogs in their behaviour, and they are equally dangerous to their prey.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (although not particularly well), swim, long distance jump and with the fivefold power of a strong person pull.
The tiger is in the same family (genus) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger does not sound like the confident roar of the lion, but rather like a sentence of gruff-sounding words.
Ocelot hunters eat small animals. If they can, they steal monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than he is.
Scientists think that otters track prey with their sense of smell and then sniff it out. They sniff it out, where they have been.
You can see in the dark very well and move unseen." Ocelot hunters stalk their prey by matching their environment and then leaping on their prey.
If a small group of animals (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originates (for example, if they move over a mountain range or a river or if they move to a new island, so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so that the new population needs to be different or adapted to be a strong competitor than what it used to be.
The original population has not changed at all. It still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, the new population adapts to its new environment, and then it looks less like the other population to the other population.
After tens of thousands or even millions of years, two populations will then look so different that they will no longer be classified as the same species.
This process is called specialization, which simply means the emergence of new species. It is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe in, and they take carbon dioxide out of the air, which humans exhale (that is, breathe out).
Plants produce their food by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses out of plants and make clothes out of plants. We eat mainly plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the largest predator of its time, so it feared nothing but other Mosasaurs.
His long jaws were equipped with more than 70 sharp teeth, plus a second set on the tongue, which meant that there was no escape for any animal that crossed his path.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a hooked tongue. He ate fish, large reptiles, other Mosasaurs and may even have been a cannibal.
He also took everything that came in to the water; even a great dinosaur like the T. Rex was not up to the task.
While most of their food is known to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual meals, including wild boar, peacock, snails and a kind of frog called the seven-headed frog.
Another difference was that the poor people ate their food on chairs, while the rich men preferred to have banquets, where they sat on the side, while they ate their meals.
The Roman courts could not contain food that came from America or Asia in later centuries.
They had no wheat, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no Romans ever ate a turkey.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a temple, which was regarded as the house of the god.
Man offered sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to conform to the will of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner altar room, which only priests could enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped temples, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The tip of the tower was a special shrine for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses did not have such a great significance.
The greatest part of the family's life was spent under the open sky.
The women cooked in the yard. Businesses were simple open-air stalls. To build a house, stone was used.
There was no forest in Canaan, so that wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the old Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled for murder from Iceland. When he traveled further west, he found Greenland and gave it the name Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes lived there already at that time.
Although all the countries were "scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the film 'The Treasure of the Templars', you may think that on the back of the Declaration of Independence there was a map of the treasure.
That is not true. Although on the reverse of the document something is written, it is not a treasure map.
The declaration of independence was written on the reverse side, with the words 'original declaration of independence, dated July 4, 1776'.
Whether or not it was written by someone, it is known that the great scroll was rolled up at the beginning of its life to be stored.
It is also possible that the note was added simply as a label.
The landing on D-Day and the subsequent battles have liberated the North of France, but the South was still not free.
He was controlled by the "Vichy"" Frenchmen. These were Frenchmen who had signed a peace treaty with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders, rather than fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies landed in southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the French liberating forces had liberated the south of France and turned towards Germany.
A civilisation is a distinct culture shared by a significant number of people who live together and work, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin word civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state and also somehow defines the size of a society.
Cities are the precursors of nations. A civilised culture implies the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint and an appropriate dissemination.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving any significant historical evidence and fail to be recognised as genuine civilisations.
While the revolutionaries were fighting for their independence, the 13 states of the Philippines formed a weak central government, consisting of only the Congress.
The Congress was not empowered to tax, and there was no national executive or judicial authority, so it relied on the states for enforcement of its laws.
In addition, he had no power to suspend tax laws and tariffs between States.
The articles required unanimous consent of all the states before they could be changed, and the states took the central government so little seriously that their representatives seldom absent themselves.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world and was the 2006 FIFA World Cup champion.
The most popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, waterpolo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula One motorsport.
Winter sports are popular in the northern regions and Italians take part in international competitions and Olympic Games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (of which Honshu is the largest) which makes Japan the seventh largest island in the world.
Because of the cluster of islands, Japan is often referred to as an archipelago.
The beginning of Taiwan goes back to the 15th century, when European sailors passed by and recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
1624 the Dutch East India Company establishes a trading post in the south west of Taiwan, which initiates a change in the cultivation methods of the indigenous people and employs Chinese workers on their rice and sugar plantations.
In the year 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan and declared it a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
The Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War, in which it ceded Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is mainly made up of three buildings, namely the Intihuatana, the Sun Temple and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex were rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they looked originally.
By 1976, thirty per cent of Machu Picchu was restored, and the restoration work continues to this day.
For example, 35 mm is the most widely used format for still photography, which corresponds to the final film format of the analogue era.
It is still made today, but it is more important that it has been taken over by digital camera formats.
In fact, the 35-mm format is confusingly measured as 36 mm in width and 24 mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this format is therefore known as 3:2.
There are many common formats (the APS format family, for example), which have exactly the same or very similar aspect ratio.
The oft-maligned and often mocked third rule is a simple rule that creates dynamism and yet preserves order in a picture.
It states that the intersection of the lines that divide a picture vertically and horizontally is the most effective place for the main motif (see example)." #
In this period of European history, the Catholic Church was under the scrutiny of the powerful and wealthy.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has kept the European states united despite different languages and customs.
His power over everyone, from the king to the common man.
One of the most important Christian beliefs states that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty.
The central authority of the church was in Rome for more than a thousand years. This concentration of power and money led many to doubt whether this principle was adhered to.
In the immediate aftermath of the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective, as it cut off the country from life-saving military and civilian supplies, despite this blockade being contrary to the generally accepted international law, which has been codified in several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain has blockaded international waters to prevent ships from entering whole oceans, which is a threat to neutral ships as well.
The limited response to this tactic was expected by Germany, and so Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolation were the dominant attitudes of most citizens and countries.
After the experience of the horrors and atrocities of the first world war, the nations wanted to avoid another such situation in the future.
1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems and a recommendation letter from Charles Batchelor (his previous boss) to Thomas Edison.
The old China had a unique method of displaying different eras. Each era in China and each family in power was a separate dynasty.
These dynasties also experienced periods of unstable division of provinces. The most famous of these periods was the period of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and the Jin dynasties.
In these times, there were bitter wars among many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The time of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died in the struggle for the highest throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metrical system, a departure from absolutism to republicanism and nationalism as well as the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a ruler alone.
Also, after the revolution, all professions were open to all male applicants, so that the most ambitious and best succeeded.
The same applies to the military, because the ranks were based on the calibre of the weapon.
The French Revolution inspired many oppressed people in the working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed was very interested in things that went beyond the everyday life. He often visited a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Nur" (light) to meditate.
The cave itself has survived the times and offers a lively picture of Mohammed's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find even though you know that it exists. Once you are in the cave, you are completely isolated.
There is nothing but the sky above, clear and beautiful, and the many surrounding mountains. From the inside of the cave, very little of this world can be seen or heard.
The Cheops Pyramid is the only of the seven wonders of the world that still stands.
The Cheops Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century BC. It is one of many great pyramids structures built to honor the dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau or the Giza Necropolis in Egypt comprises several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built to honour the Pharaoh Cheops and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honour his wives and family members.
The "sprinkle" symbol looks like a V and the "sprinkle" symbol looks like a square, with the lower line missing.
Up means that you start at the top and you should pull the bow.
The erasing generates a softer sound, while the erasing is more powerful and expressive.
You are free to add your own pencil marks; however, the printed lines are there for musical reasons, so they should be respected.
The frightened King Louis XIV, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two small children (the 11 year old Marie-Therese and the 4 year old Louis-Charles) as well as the sister of the King, Madame Elisabeth were forced to return to Paris by a mob of market women on 6 October 1789.
They travelled in a carriage back to Paris, surrounded by a mob of people who threatened the king and queen with violence.
The mob forced the king and queen to open their windows wide.
Sometime later, a member of the mob turned his head to the king's guards who were killed in Versailles.
The US imperialist expenditures in the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the U. S. to cover the bulk of the expenditure, and the interest on the bonds flowed through the banks of Wall Street in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the superprofits that came from the continued exploitation of the Filipino people were the fundamental profits of the US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you must first understand the context in which they were founded.
The period in which the events took place is generally referred to as the Middle Ages, a period in European history that spans the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which all converged around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technology push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that the human fate is determined by a fundamental logic that is linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
The most common interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas. Firstly, that the development of technology is itself a path that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and secondly, that technology itself has effects on societies that are more intrinsic than socially determined.
It can be said that the motor vehicle is a necessary development of roads.
Although a national road network for only a small number of cars is economically not viable, new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The widespread ownership of cars also leads to an increased number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques in the health sector for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a strong, cultural deterministic element, which was drawn from writers like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography was the geography that molded individuals. Over time, customs and cultures developed with reference to this geography and these, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
So Paris is known as the fashion capital of the world today, so Constantinople was the fashion capital of the empire-ruled Europe.
His fame as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 BC and lasted until around 1100 BC.
His status declined in the 12th century, which was mainly due to the Crusaders returning with gifts such as silk and spices which were considered more valuable than the offerings of the Byzantine markets.
At that time, the title of the world's fashion capital was also transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th-11th and the 14th century.
At the beginning, the clothing was strongly marked by the culture of Byzantium in the East.
However, Western styles are 25 to 30 years behind the rest of the world in terms of communication channels.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop a style of its own. One of the most important developments of the time was that people began to use buttons to fasten their clothing.
Agricultural economy is agriculture that aims to produce as many food products as possible to meet the needs of the farmer or farmer's family.
The subsistence economy is a simple, often biological farming method that uses surplus, in the region's native soil, and with rotational farming or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
In the past, most farmers were subsistence farmers and in many developing countries this is still the case.
Subcultures bring together people who feel neglected by the mainstream, and enable them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be differentiated on the basis of age, ethnicity, class, place and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as such can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual or geographical.
The members of a subculture often signal their membership by a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits and jargon.
One of the most common methods of illustrating the importance of socialization is to rely on the few unfortunate cases of children who have not been socialized by adults because of neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse during their childhood.
Those children are called "wild" or "wild." Some wild children were captured by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, the neglect of the child was due to the inability of the parents to accept the severe intellectual or physical limitations of the child.
Wolf cubs may have suffered massive child abuse or suffered traumatic experiences before they were abandoned or escaped.
Others have been reared by animals; some have lived alone in the wild.
If it was completely raised by animals, the wild child displays behaviours (in the context of its physical capabilities) that almost completely match those of its specific carer, such as its fear or indifference to people.
Project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, but scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support that helps individuals in a new learning situation, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Armour can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffold, but also the little office stapler in Microsoft Office.
Virtual assistance is built into the software and should question, suggest and explain the steps that the student may not be able to cope with on his own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse, and exploitation. 
No child should be forced to grow up in a environment that is not caring, loving and educationally oriented, but many are forced to do so.
For us, the care system is a piece of security for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving caregivers, a stable training and a reliable health care.
The shelter should cover all the needs that they had not been able to receive in the home from which they had been removed.
The internet connects both elements of mass communication, as well as interpersonal communication.
The specific features of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the benefit-cost approach.
For example, learning and socialisation are cited as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal engagement and sustained relationships were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied the public reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings led to important insights into the interpretation of microexpressions, short-lived facial movements.
In particular, it is claimed that one can tell whether someone is lying by deducing the minimal changes in facial expression.
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks showed how people who cannot understand language because of a brain injury can still correctly assess the honesty of people.
He even claims that the ability to interpret human behaviour may be shared with dogs like the dog in the picture.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation results in new genetic variations and selection removes these from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with each generation back and forth.
Out in the savannah, it is very difficult for a primate with a digestive system like ours to meet its nutritional needs from available plant sources.
In addition, it has grave consequences if you do not: depression, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The easiest to access plant resources would have been proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for us unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide large amounts of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
Overall, it should not come as a surprise that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a similar way as chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep compensation is the process of goal-directed awakening during the normal sleep periods and the period of short sleep (10-60 minutes) later.
This can be achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without completely waking you up.
If you are someone who imagines the alarm clock in the night, you can place it on the other side of the room so that you have to leave the bed to turn it off.
Another way of looking at it is that you should drink a lot of fluids before going to bed (especially water or tea, which is known for its urinary-tonic effect). You will have to get up to pee.
The degree of inner calm that a person has is inversely related to the degree of tension in the body and mind.
The lower the stress is, the more positive the existing life force. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has been expanded to include the path of love of the Mahayana and many techniques of the Indian yoga.
The Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (awakening energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
In the centre of tibetan meditation is the goddess yoga. By visualizing various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are opened and the enlightened consciousness is born.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to a cooperation between the USSR and the US. After the war, the collision of systems, the course and culture led to the countries being at odds.
Two years after the end of the war, the former Allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
He should last for the next 40 years and be carried out in reality by proxy armies on battlefields in Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defence was already completely broken and the only hope was in a retreat and a reorganisation along the Romanian bridgehead.
The plans were quickly obsolete when 800,000 Soviet soldiers invaded the white Russian and Ukrainian fronts and created after they invaded in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements in the eastern regions of Poland.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is the most efficient method of transporting large human and goods masses over the seas.
The task of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that a country is able to transport people and goods and at the same time to hinder the enemy's ability to do so.
One of the most significant recent examples of this is the North Atlantic Campaign during World War II. The Americans attempted to bring personnel and material to the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy attempted to stop this traffic mainly by submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Britain exactly as the rest of Europe.
It is believed that goats were domesticated in the Zagros Mountains in Iran some 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribal peoples began to keep them as livestock to get easily at their milk, fur, skin and flesh.
Sheep were usually kept in herds, which wandered on hills or other pasture areas. They were cared for by shepherds, just like the more familiar sheepherders; often were they children or adolescents. This grazing system is still used
In the 16th century, England built railways to support agriculture.
Although the railway tracks consisted of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses which pulled the carriages to reach higher speeds and to carry heavier loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the time.
Since the beginning of the century, there have been barriers introduced to ensure that the railway network is protected. Gradually, however, it became apparent that railways carrying a railway track are more efficient.
This was the usual practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron railway tracks were introduced.
The first known means of locomotion was walking. The human species began to walk about two million years ago with the appearance of the Homo erectus (which means "standing man").
Your predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk as regularly as you.
Two-footed species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3,9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate future suffering a little bit.
This is only one of many cases. If you want to deal with the root of the problem, then you should find the cause and treat it.
It is really obvious that the world has changed due to the scientific and technological advances of mankind, and that the problems have become more serious due to overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles of people.
After his adoption by the Congress on 4 July, a handwritten draft, signed by the Congress President John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to the printer of John Dunlap.
In the course of the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as "Dunlap broadsides.
The first public reading of the report was given by John Nixon in the Independence Hall on 8 July.
A copy was sent to Washington on 6 July, which was read to the troops in New York on 9 July. A copy reached London on 10 August.
There are still 25 Dunlap broadsheets that are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwriting has not survived the times.
Many paleontologists now believe that there is a group of dinosaurs that survived and are still alive. We call them birds.
Many people do not see dinosaurs as dinosaurs because they have feathers and fly.
But many things about birds still look like dinosaurs.
They have feet with claws and toenails, lay eggs and run on both hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
. Almost all of the computers used today are based on the processing of information in binary form.
A binary number can only have one of two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or as bits, to use the computer jargon.
A toxic overload can be difficult to detect at first. The symptoms, for example vomiting, are so general that it is difficult to make a diagnosis immediately.
The best sign of a poisoning by ingestion is the presence of an open container of medicines or toxic household chemicals.
Look at the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison.
The term 'wasp' is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this insect group.
This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs. These are insects that are very adaptable to parasitizing humans.
Rabies flies and bedbugs are nidicolous, that is, they adapt to their nests or homes in order to live there.
In the United States of America, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which is the most common neurological disease among adults aged younger and middle-aged.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and the peripheral nerves.
Studies have shown that the risk of getting MS is twice as high for women as for men.
A couple can decide that it is not in their own interest or in the interest of their child to raise a baby.
This couple can choose an adoption plan for their baby.
In adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights, so that another couple can take over the parental responsibilities.
The main aim of science is to discover how the world works. This method is in fact the basis of most scientific investigations.
But it is not just about experimentation, where an experiment is a test that aims to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses.
Natural scientists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts and in particular on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were accepted.
With the loss of Greek language skills, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behaviour are often largely due to the presence of body-specific rhythms and their production by biological clocks.
From a cycle certain behaviours are known in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that even in absence of external signals continue to oscillate in free-swinging cycles.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the major evidences that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacteria.
They took two experiments, one in which they either labelled the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or a protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material concerned, and whether it is a germ cell.
Mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cancer or death.
Natur-based tourism draws people to visit areas of natural beauty, including wild plants and animals.
Exemplary activities are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
A clear example of this is the visit, photography and studying orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave small provincial towns by car to go to their workplace and are passed by other people whose workplace is the place they just left.
In this dynamic transport pendulum, everyone is connected to a transport system based on private cars, and support it.
Now, science has pointed out that this massive carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone takes part in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport systems.
You will rarely hear complaints about the water quality or the collapse of bridges in developed countries.
Why do transport systems fail so often? Are transport engineers just incompetent? Or is something fundamental going on here?
Transport flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to predict the behaviour of drivers because it is not possible to predict 100% of their behaviour.
Unfortunately, drivers tend to behave reasonably, so traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be represented mathematically in a rough way.
To better represent the flow of traffic, the three main characteristics were defined: (1) river, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in planning, designing and operating facilities on the road.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the skies. Their ability to fly enabled them to evade enemies more easily and to find more efficient food and mates.
Most insects can fold their wings along their bodies.
They have a wider choice of small boots in which they can hide themselves from predators.
Today, butterflies and moths are the only insects that can not fold their wings.
In the past, a man named Aristarch claimed that the sun was at the centre of the movements of the solar system.
Many people thought he was right, but many others believed the opposite: That the solar system including the sun (and even the other stars) revolve around the Earth.
It seems reasonable, because it doesn't seem to move the Earth, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest and the most water-rich river in the world. It flows more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, with some stretches of up to six miles wide.
About 20 percent of the water that flows through the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon main stream is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It takes water from thousands of smaller rivers into it.
Although the building of pyramids from stone until the end of the Old Kingdom continued, the pyramids of Gizeh in their size and the technical perfection of their construction never surpassed them.
Egyptians in the ancient New Kingdom gazed at the monuments of their forefathers, which were then more than a thousand years old.
Vatican City has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language of most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known to mankind since the ancient times, since these can be found in their original form in nature and are easily extracted with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, posited the theory that all things are made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These elements were earth, water, air and fire.
This was more in line with the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma. He did, however, state that they could also change into new substances, to form what we see.
Alloys are a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are other metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain low amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
The universe is made up of matter in its entirety. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them would fit in the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was invented by many people to be a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, the pencil has been supplanted by new writing methods, so that it has been pushed back in its status and in its use.
Today, people write news on computer screens, without ever having to get close to a cliff.
We can be very excited about what will come out of the keyboard if something newer comes along.
The atomic bomb is based on the principle that energy is required to combine a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like if you roll a heavy car up a hill. When the core is split, some of that energy will be released.
Some atoms have unstable cores, which means that they can decay even at very low or even no activation.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The outer layer is about 70 km thick on the near side and about 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner at the sea-coast and thicker at the highlands.
On the flank, there could be more Maria, because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
These theories focus on what people are motivated by or attracted to.
The theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized during their growing up.
The theories concern what motivates certain people to want exactly the things they do, and what influences them to do or not to do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two patterns can emerge when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the boys" (or of the girls).
This kind of manager has problems in making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary measures, issuing performance appraisals, assigning responsibilities and enforcing discipline.
At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable individual who has to do everything differently than the team has done and takes everything for himself.
The manager is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behaviour often leads to friction between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are managed in the same way as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members have often the function of a contact point for their immediate physical group.
Many team members have greater autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams may meet in different time zones that may not be taken into account by the local leadership.
The presence of a truly invisible team (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also an unique component of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the leadership team that reports to each member. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organisation undertake the time-consuming process of introducing an organisational learning concept? A goal for the practical implementation of organisational learning concepts is innovation.
If all available resources are effectively used by all departments of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can arise.
In the end, the joint work of an organisation can lead to a new innovative method of responding to customer needs.
Before an organisation can be innovative, the leadership must develop a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and learning and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the concept of the continuum as a way of helping organizations become more effective.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognitive processes. Thus they limit the research field and make it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that various types of brain damage such as trauma, injuries and tumours can influence behaviour and cause changes in some brain functions.
New emerging technologies allow us to see and explore certain brain structures and processes for the first time.
This provides us with a lot of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand what is going on in our heads.
KI is not only strongly associated with science fiction, but is also an important branch of computer science that deals with behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence includes the production of machines that require intelligent behavior.
These are examples of the ability to control, set strategies and timetables, to answer customer questions and to answer handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become autonomous disciplines, which are focused on finding solutions to real-life problems.
The KI system is now used in many areas of industry, medicine, engineering and military and is also incorporated into numerous software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of every school. Often a teacher would like to take her pupils to places where a bus journey is not possible.
Virtual excursions are a technical solution. Pupils can view museum objects from their classrooms, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful art works.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design and build a website every year about their trip to the capital of the state. The website is updated every year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a collection album.
Blogs can also help improve the writing skills of students. Although students at the beginning of their blog experience often have a sloppy grammar and spelling, that changes usually when there is a readership.
Students are often a very critical audience, so the blogger tries to improve his writing style to avoid criticism.
Blogs force students to learn more about the world around them. The need to attract the public's interest inspires students to write smart and interesting posts (Toto, 2004).
Blogging encourages collaboration and encourages students to continue learning outside of the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet material, students can define their own positions in relation to texts by other and present their own perspectives on particular topics.
Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital of Canada and it is home to a number of art galleries and museums that present Canada's past and present.
In the south are the Niagara Falls, and in the north, the untouched beauty of nature spreads out to Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and other characteristics make Ontario as what is commonly regarded as Canadian.
A large area further north is almost deserted and some are almost wild.
A population comparison that many surprises: There are more African Americans in the USA than Canadian citizens.
The islands in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Africa are called the Seychelles.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, as far as the animal world is concerned, a separate continent.
The majority of the smaller islands are independent nations or attached to France and are known as luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to the islands, and in the Comoros and Mayotte it was very successful.
The European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
The region is bounded by the Sahel zone in the north and by the Atlantic Ocean in the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all women travelling claim to be married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Also wearing a ring is helpful (don't wear a ring that looks too expensive.)
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they consider to be an assault, and that it is not uncommon to be beaten, handcuffed, etc.
Keep your principles firm, even if you reject men, and don't be afraid to defend your position (cultural differences aside; that does not mean that it is okay!)
The present Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Merinides as a strategic port with the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after a quake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan built the city as Dar el Beida again and it was named Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
It is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as Tagines, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of tinned food, but that is all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the easternmost part of Rwanda.
In 2002 the city of Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city, especially the city centre, under itself." #
While Goma is relatively safe, it is important to plan your stay outside Goma carefully to learn about the ongoing fighting in North-Kivu.
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of the volcano Nyiragongo, as well as for some of the cheapest gorilla tracking tours in Africa." #
You can use Bodabodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The usual (local) fare is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short ride
This in combination with its relative remoteness has made "Timbuktu" a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Although Timbuktu is known as a tourist attraction and has a airport, it is nowadays a poor city.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger because of the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the most important stops on the PBS special "Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the cities of the country, because it is more of an Arab than an African feel.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa. It borders in the east with Mozambique, in the north with Zimbabwe and in
The park has an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecosystems, each supporting a different animal species.
He is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered to be the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
How all South African national parks collect daily entry fees.
It can also be worthwhile to buy a wild card, which grants access either to selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the namesake of the territory of Hong Kong and is the focus of many tourists.
The buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline are being compared with a shimmering bar chart that is visible through the present of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, you should leave the island and head to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
The bulk of the city formation of Hong Kong Island is concentrated along the newly acquired land along the north coast.
This is the place that the British colonists have taken over. If you look for traces of colonial past in the area, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest mangrove forest and extend for 80 km from the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland to the coast.
The Sundarbans were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not only mangrove swamps - they also include some of the last remaining remnants of the mighty forest that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3850 km2, of which one third is covered by water and marshes.
The Sundarbans are a nature reserve since 1966, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer there.
Buses run all day long from the district-wide bus station (on the other side of the river) and most buses, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30 am." #
Buses are often full, so it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
Taxi services offer a fast and convenient way to get to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a curved cable bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 metres high, their length is 378 metres and they have two lanes with 3,50 m width.
The bridge's height under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction work was completed in August 2011, but the opening for traffic was only completed in March 2017.
The bridge should be completed in September 2017. It is expected that the Brazilian customs checkpoints will then be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group inhabiting the present-day Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters, who also practiced
The Chaco region was also the home of other indigenous groups, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering
Paraguay, formerly the province of West Indies, was named after the Spanish conquistadors who came to the area in the 16th century.
The Spaniards began the colonization period which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for its polo team and players to be among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at Las Cañitas Polo fields.
Small tournaments and competitions can be watched here at any time of the year.
Informations about competitions and polo field ticket outlets can be found at the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is set in accordance with the value of the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged in the only bank on the island, which is opposite the FIC West Store.
The British pound is generally accepted everywhere on the islands and at Stanley credit cards. Also US dollars are often accepted.
On the remote islands, credit cards may not be accepted, but British and American currency can be accepted; ask the owners in advance about the payment method accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland Islands' currency outside the islands, so you should exchange your money before you leave the islands.
 Montevideo is located south of the equator, so it is summer in the northern hemisphere and winter in the southern hemisphere.
Montevideo is in the tropics. In summer months, temperatures can reach +30 °C.
The winter can be misleadingly cold: the temperatures rarely go below freezing point, but wind and moisture lead to a feeling of colder than what the thermometer shows.
There are no distinct wet or dry seasons: The amount of precipitation remains about the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to the sight of humans, wildlife still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
In accordance with the instructions of the park authorities, visitors should keep at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals!
Even if Bisons, Wapitis, Elche, Bears and all the big animals look peaceful, it can still happen that they turn on each other.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not take enough distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so leave them enough space.
Be aware that odours attract bears and other wildlife. Avoid carrying strong odours or cooking food and keep your storage clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa and has a population of less than 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 18th century and is the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the scene of a shameful stalemate in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All ships except one British warship were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans died.
While the Mau movement organized a peaceful demonstration in the city, a peaceful assembly in the city led to the killing of the chief of the Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III tribe.
There are many beaches in Auckland, and the most popular ones are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the Pera district) lie on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
 " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " 
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located at the port of Waitemata, in the upper-class suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
There are family beaches, which are sometimes overcrowded, with a beautiful promenade along the coast. Swimming is here safe.
The most important local beer is "Number One". It is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is "Manta".
There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines are probably better tolerated.
The local tap water can be safely drunk, but if you are worried about it, you will also find easily available bottled water.
For Australians, the idea of coffee ""flat white"" is foreign. A small black is ""espresso"" and a small cup of coffee is ""cappuccino"" with no milk.
The hot chocolate is Belgian standard. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many trips to the reef take place all year round and injuries caused by any of these causes on the reef are rare.
However, you should follow the advice of local authorities and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
Shellfish are common in the vicinity of beaches and in the vicinity of river mouths from October to April north of 1770.
Haies exist, but they are rarely aggressive towards people. Most of the sharks would run away if they saw people.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live in the sea, their primary habitat is in river mouths north of Rockhampton.
A reservation in advance gives the traveller the assurance that he will have a place to stay when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although you may also book other lodging options, such as tents, through a travel agency.
Travel agents usually offer packages in which breakfast, transport to and from the airport or even a combination of flight and hotel are included.
You can also hold your reservation for you if you need time to reconsider the offer or to obtain further documents for your destination (for example, a visa).
Any changes or requests should be made directly to the travel agent and not to the hotel.
Many festivalgoers decide to camp out at the festival, and most visitors believe that this is an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to get there early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that on some of the festival stages, music will continue to play until late into the night, even though the music on the main stages has stopped.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin condition, as breaking through ice can cause quite a disturbing noise for the most affected.
Cruise ships also offer the opportunity to visit St Petersburg. Passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos generally try very hard to keep guests as long as possible and to spend as much money as possible. There are usually no windows or watches, and exits are sometimes difficult to find.
You usually have a special offer for food, drink and entertainment to keep the guests entertained and ensure that they stay.
Some casinos offer alcoholic beverages free of charge. However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good players know how important it is to remain sober." #
If you want to travel in high latitudes or over mountain passes, you should be prepared for snow, ice and temperatures below freezing.
On icy and snowy roads, the liability is low and you can't drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
In very short time, so much snow can fall that you can get stuck.
The visibility can also be affected by falling or drifting snow or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows. x
On the other hand, there are harsh and snowy conditions in many countries, and the traffic runs all year round largely uninterrupted.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
Safari is a common term in the English language for a trip to see the incredible wildlife of Africa, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars close, and the standard equipment enables good visibility.
Lions, leopards and cheetahs are often timid and you can observe them better with a telescope.
A bushwalk (also known as a bushwalk, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking
The Paralympics will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held at other venues in Japan throughout the year.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Olympic Games after it hosted the 1964 Games.
If you have booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the rescheduling was announced, you could find yourself in a difficult situation.
The cancellation policies vary, but most of them were not in effect until the end of March, for the Olympic Games were to be held in July.
It is estimated that most tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, a typical ticket will be ¥7,000.
Dry clothes can be ironed when they are dry. Many hotels provide irons and ironing boards, even if you are not present in the room.
If there is no iron available or you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer if one is available.
Please give it eight, that the material does not get too hot (it can shrink it or lead to serious burns in extreme cases).
To clean water there are many different methods. Some of them are more effective to prevent certain dangers.
In some areas it is enough to boil water for a minute, in others it will have to be several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies greatly, and if you have any doubts, then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that they do not know about from their home regions.
Invasive species can destroy food, cause irritation or even cause allergic reactions, poison or transmit disease.
Infections as such or dangerous animals that can cause injury or death to humans are not usually classified as vermin.
Tax-free shopping is the possibility to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and consumption taxes.
Travellers whose destination country has a high tax rate can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, particularly in the case of products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmount on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway is the most challenging driving section, as it often leads through remote, undeveloped countryside.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: steep gradients, narrow roads and sharp curves are more prevalent here.
The speed limits given are noticeably lower than in the previous and following sections - usually between 35 and 40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict compliance is even more important than usual.
But interestingly, the mobile coverage here is much better than in many other areas of the route, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German bread is very tasty. In Bavaria, it is very rich and varied, just as in the southern neighbouring country Austria.
Bread is widely available, with apples being boiled all year round and pears and plums being used in summer.
Many German baked goods also contain nuts, almonds or other nuts. Popular cakes often fit particularly well to a strong cup of coffee.
If you wish to produce small, but rich baked goods, try this, which is called Berliner, pancakes or crepes in different regions.
Curry is a dish that is based on herbs and spices, with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either dry or wet depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is used.
With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a catch-all term that encompasses a wide range of regional cuisines that are found throughout the country.
When the term is used without any further attributes, it usually refers to the food that is traditionally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine, which is now widely spread throughout the island group, offers a huge range of simple spiced dishes. As flavouring agents, the Javans prefer nuts, chilis, sugar (especially javan coconut sugar) and a number of aromatic spices.
Steigbügel are aids for the feet of the riders, which hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They give the horse more stability, but there are security concerns because the feet of the horse may possibly get caught in them.
If a rider falls off the horse and hooks his foot on the stirrup, he can be pulled along if the horse passes. To minimise this risk, a number of precautions can be taken.
Firstly, most riders wear boots with a flat sole and a smooth, fairly narrow heel.
In addition, some saddles, in particular English saddles, have safety buckles which allow the saddle to fall off when it is pulled by a falling rider back onto the horse.
The Cochamó Valley - Chile's most important climbing destination, known as the Yosemite National Park of South America, with a great number of large granite walls and -cliffs.
The summits offer a breathtaking view. Climbers from all over the world discover new routes along the walls, which offer endless opportunities.
Skiing and snowboarding are popular sports in which skis or snowboards are attached to the feet and descend a slope over a snow covered surface.
Skiing is a popular holiday activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski-bunnies" who plan their entire holiday around the skiing at a particular place.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depicting skiers go back to 5000 BC!
The origins of skiing as a sport go back at least to the 17th century and in 1861 the first ski club in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Skitourengehen" or "Skiwandern" is also called "Skitourengehen" or "Skiwandern.
It resembles alpine skiing or mountaineering, but it does not necessarily include it, as these are carried out in steep terrain and require much stiffer skis and boots.

In good conditions you can cover greater distances than you would on a walking trip – only very rarely you will reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy pack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has a number of independent countries. Normally, you would have to apply for multiple visas and go through multiple passport controls if you want to travel through several countries.
The Schengen area works in this respect somewhat like a country.
So long as you remain in this zone, you can usually cross the border without having to go through the passport control again.
According to the new rules, you do not need a Schengen visa for each of the Schengen states individually, which saves time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universal definition of what is considered an antique. Some tax authorities define over 100 year old goods as antiques.
The definition has geographical deviations, where the age limit can be lower in regions like North America than in Europe.
Handmade products could be termed "antique", although they are younger than similar products produced in mass production.
The reindeer breeding is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi, and the culture around the trade is also important for many who work in other professions.
Also, not all Sámi have kept large herds of reindeer, but have lived mainly from fishing, hunting and so on.
Today, many Sámi work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
In addition, the term ""gypsie"" is often used by non-Roma as a slur, because it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma.

You can also consult the advice of other governments as your own. Their advice is however tailored to the citizens of their own countries.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may be confronted with other situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Conferences are merely a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views expressed are often superficial, general and in comparison to the more detailed information, which is available elsewhere, to be too simplistic.
Weather is the umbrella term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, social disruption or loss of life.
Floods can occur anywhere on the globe and there are different types of them, which depend on the geography, topography and the atmospheric conditions
Strong winds, hail, heavy rains and forest fires are forms and effects of weather, as well as thunderstorms, tornados,
Regional and seasonal weather phenomena are, for example, blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
Tourists are urged to be on the lookout for any type of weather that affects their region, because this may affect all their travel plans.
Everyone planning to travel to a country that is a war zone should have a professional training for that purpose.
A search for ""course on hostile environments"" will probably show the address of a local company.
A course covers all the problems discussed here usually much more in-depth, usually in combination with practical experience.
A course is usually between two and five days long and includes role-playing, lots of first aid and sometimes training in weapons.
There are many books and journals on survival in the wilderness, but very few on war zones.
Travellers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure that they have valid travel documents for their return.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with a non-specified gender (X) or documents that have been updated to reflect the desired name and gender, is different.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents is also very varied.
The searches at security checkpoints have become more intrusive in the aftermath of 11 September.
Transgender people should not expect that their privacy and dignity will be respected when passing through the scanners.
Riss-currents are the return flow of broken waves at the beach, often at reefs or similar.
Because of the underwater topology, the return flow concentrates in a few deeper areas and a fast current can form there.
Most deaths occur by exhaustion trying to swim against the current, which turns out to be impossible.
If you get out of the current, it is not difficult to get back in.
You should try to get somewhere where you won't be caught. Alternatively, if you are noticed, you might wait for rescue.
The shock of return is earlier than the culture shock (the honeymoon phase is not as strong), lasts longer and is more serious.
Travellers who were able to adapt easily to the new culture find it difficult to adapt to their home culture.
When one returns from an overseas trip, one has adapted to a different culture and has abandoned some of the behaviours of his home culture.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding because they knew that travellers had to adapt to a new country.
Maybe we don't expect returning travellers to show patience and understanding.
The sound and light show at the Pyramids is one of the most interesting attractions for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and while it is still quiet before the show begins.
Normally, you hear the sounds of tourists and sellers. The history of sounds and light is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx is used as a background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids, where different pyramids are illuminated.
The Southern Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most stations. In 2020 there were sixteen active.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the Kola Peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands are Livingston Island and Deception, where the overflowing caldera of a still active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbour.
Elsworthland is the region south of the Bellingshausen Sea, which is bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula rise here and then split off into the plateau, forming the 360 km long chain of Ellsworth mountains, which is divided by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part or the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak is the Mount Vinson with 4892 m height.
In remote areas without mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone can be the only option.
A satellite phone is not a substitute for a mobile phone, because you have to be in clear sight of a satellite, to make a call.
The service is often used by ships, including pleasure boats, as well as expeditions that require data and voice links.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you further information about the connection to this service.
An ever more popular option for people planning to take a year off is to study and take courses abroad.
This is particularly popular among university graduates, as it enables them to take a year off without affecting their studies.
In many cases, participation in an exchange year programme can actually improve your chances of getting a university degree in your home country.
In most cases, a fee is charged for these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for boating tours. The "land of thousands of lakes" has also thousands of islands - in the lakes and in the archipelagoes.
For the archipelagos and seas, you don't need a yacht.
Although the coastal island groups and the largest lakes are actually big enough for every yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is the national pastime in Finland, one in six or eight owns a boat.
This is similar to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the ratio is one to fourty.)
Most eastbound cruises include a longer stay in St. Petersburg in Russia.
That means that you can visit the historic city for several whole days while you are on the ship and then return home and stay overnight on the ship.
If you only go on a tour of the brothels, you do not need a separate visa (in 2009).
Some cruises offer Berlin in Germany as a destination. You can see on the map above that Berlin is far from the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Travelling can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and from all walks of life, especially if they have never travelled or had a traumatic experience behind them.
That is not shameful: it is nothing but the personal fears and prejudices that many people have.
More about the functioning of aircraft and the processes that take place during a flight can help some people to overcome the fear that is associated with the unknown or with the feeling that they do not have control.
Courier companies are paid well for the fast delivery of things. Often, the time is an extremely important factor in corporate documents, trade goods or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the larger companies use their own aircraft, but on other routes and at smaller companies, difficulties occurred.
If they shipped things via air freight, the loading and customs clearance could take several days on some routes.
The only way to get it done faster was to send it as a baggage.
The obvious way to fly in first or business class is to put a large sum of money on the table (or, better still, to force your own company to pay for it).
That is not cheap: As a rough guide you can expect to pay up to four times the normal Economy fare for the Business and the double fare for the first class.
In general, it is pointless to look for discounts on direct flights from A to B even if you are only interested in business or first class seats.
The airlines know very well that there is a certain core group of airplanes that are prepared to pay a lot of money to get to their destination quickly and conveniently, and they demand appropriate prices.
The capital of Moldova is Kishinev. The native language is Romanian, but many people speak Russian.
Moldavia is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
This conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
While the political negotiations failed, economic relations between these two parts of the Republic of Moldova have been restored.
The most important religion in Moldova is the Christian Orthodox.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest harbour after Istanbul and a very good transport hub.

Do not vandalize the site by painting or scratching graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants speak Catalan more often, and most of the population can speak Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, as it is legally defined as the first official language.

The Plitwitzer Seen National Park is heavily forested, with mainly oak, fir and pine trees and it offers a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
He has a remarkable diversity of plant communities, thanks to the many microclimates, different soils and different altitudes.
The area is also home to a very large variety of animal and bird species.
There are rare species of fauna, such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, foxes, wild cats and hens, as well as many more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts that reach up to the knees and cover their shoulders.
In most monasteries there are no diapers for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own diaper, especially one in bright colors, the monk or nun will smile at you at the gate.

The light pollution at its peak did not pose a problem that it does today, and are usually found in cities or on university grounds that are easier to reach than the ones built in recent times.
Modern telescopes are immense structures in remote areas with favourable atmospheric conditions.
The viewing of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, is a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originates from China, where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.

Many of the traditions associated with the festival were also adopted by non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries.
There is tradition to spend the night of Easter in an open place to see the sunrise.
Of course there are Christian-theological explanations for this tradition, but it could also be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
Traditional churches hold vigils on Saturday evening, during the Easter weekend, when the celebrations of the congregations often begin at midnight, when the resurrection of Christ is celebrated.
All animals which originally came to the islands by swimming, flying or by drowning have arrived here.

From the first people to visit the Galapagos Islands, many animals have been introduced, including goats, horses, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the Polar Night, which means that the sun does not rise over the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, since the sky is usually darker or lighter around the clock.
