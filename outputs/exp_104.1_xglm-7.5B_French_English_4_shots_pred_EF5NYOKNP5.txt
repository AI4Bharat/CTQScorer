The American Gymnastics Federation supports the letter of the US Olympic Committee and accepts the absolute necessity of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We are in agreement with the statement of the USOC (United States Olympic Committee) that our athletes and clubs, as well as their sport, could be better served by going forward and making substantive changes within our organisation, rather than revoking accreditation.

It confirms not only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is widely accepted, but provides details that fossils cannot usually provide, such as the colour and the tridimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this bird’s feathers were brown-tan on top and pale or carotenoid on the bottom.
This discovery also allows us to better understand the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a fully developed root, called spine, but show other features typical of feathers – bristles and barbules – the researchers have concluded that the spine was probably an evolutionary development later on.
The plumage suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for temperature regulation or display.
The scientists say that this is indeed the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, but the sample reveals a plumage belonging to an adult, and not to a juvenile.
A car bomb exploded at the headquarters of the police in Gaziantep, Turkey, this morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.

The police in Madhya Pradesh have recovered the laptop and mobile phone stolen.
The assistant inspector general D. K. Arya said: "We have arrested five people for violating the Swiss citizen, and we have recovered her mobile phone and laptop.
The accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the police commissioner, said that the accused had their faces covered when they appeared before the court.
However, three people were present in the house when the car crashed into it, and none were injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured to the head.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed to allow rescue teams to extract the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was then admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been indicted for the murder of her son by the Sheriff Court of Edinburgh.
She is in custody awaiting trial, but eyewitness testimony could be compromised because her picture has been widely disseminated.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but the Scottish courts operate differently and have considered that publishing photos was potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, of Dundee University, notes that "journalists seem to be following a dangerous line if they publish photographs, etc. of suspects.
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is responsible for all prosecutions, has explained to journalists that no further comment will be made at least until the prosecution.
According to leak, the document will deal with the dispute at the border that the Palestinians claim based on the existing borders before the Middle East war of 1967.
In addition to other issues discussed, there is the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel requires a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of ten years from the signing of an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority only agrees to a five-year period.
The shooters of the trial supplementary control of parasites had to be closely monitored by rangers, for the trial was being monitored and its effectiveness being assessed.
In the context of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) inc., qualified volunteers have been recruited, in the context of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, temporary conservation manager for the NPWS, the four shooters designated for the first abattoir campaign have been properly trained and instructed in safety procedures.
Martelly has just installed a new provisional Electoral Council (CEP) made up of nine members.
It is the fifth PEC of Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the dissolution of the previous CEP in order to initiate a new electoral process.
This commission was the response of Martelly to the massive protests against the regime that began in October.
The violent protests sometimes have been triggered by the absence of elections, some of which were supposed to take place in 2011.
About 60 iPods have been reported overheating, causing six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had received 27 accidents involving these aircraft.
Last week, the METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which it described as "minor.
The Ministry of Finance has reacted by calling it "really regrettable" that the report was postponed.
The earthquake struck the Mariannes at 7:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The Emergency Management Office of the Northern Mariana Islands said that no damage had been reported in this country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has declared that there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer took hostages from Hong Kong tourists in Manila, the Philippines' capital.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
A number of hostages have been saved, and at least six of them have been confirmed to have been killed so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, have been released prematurely, as have the Filipino photographers.
The photographers took their place next to an elderly lady who needed to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and became a doctor.
He went on to a training course in obstetrics and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When he was working at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature births during his spare time. 
His research has shown that if a hormone is administered, it will accelerate the pulmonary maturation of the baby.
Xinhua reported that the government investigators recovered two flight recorders (black boxes) on Wednesday.
Other fighters also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: ‘Luna was the first extreme queen. My first manager. Luna died on two moons. A unique moment, just like she. A strong woman.’
Dustin 'Goldust' Runnels commented that 'Luna was as strange as me... or even more... I love her and she will be missed... I hope she rests in a better place.'
A survey carried out among 1 400 people before the federal elections in 2010 revealed that the number of opponents to the transformation of Australia into a republic had increased by 8 % since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the federal election campaign that she thought Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 per cent of those interviewed share this view, and want the Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch to rule Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 % of those questioned felt that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 % felt that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was required to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical condition was questioned.
He could not take the necessary medicines to overcome his pain, these being banned within the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer scientist at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest known prime number to date.
Many people have checked the discovery using different equipment and software at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Cosmic comets may have been a source of water for the earth, as well as organic matter which may form proteins and promote life.
The scientists hope to understand how planets form, and in particular how the Earth formed, because comets have collided with it for a long time.
Cuomo, 53 years old, began his term as governor in January and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He described the rumours as 'babble and foolish political talk'.
We think that he will be the next President of the Council.
According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that would enable aircraft to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, reducing carbon emissions.
It is based on satellite technology, and not on ground-based radar systems used previously, which enables air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and to provide pilots with more detailed information.
The additional transport is non-existent and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking and relay stations are not available on the ground.
The fear of not having transport caused the possibility that the game could be played behind closed doors, without the fans of the teams.
A study published on Thursday in Science revealed the origin of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and at Uppsala University in Sweden have indicated that the new species had evolved in only two generations, although this process had been estimated to be much longer, due to reproductive interbreeding between a Darwin's finch endemic, Geospiza fortis, and the finch immigrant with a conical beak, Geospiza conirostris
You can shape gold in many ways. It can be rolled into small pieces.
It can be twisted into fine thread, which can be twisted and woven. It can be hammered or laminated into sheets.
It can be made very fine, and glued onto another metal. It can be so fine that it has sometimes been used to decorate hand-painted images in manuscripts called "enlumined manuscripts.
That's what we call a chemical product's pH. You can make a pH indicator by using red cabbage juice.
The beetroot juice changes colour according to the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the chemical tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electron (because hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron)." #
Mix the dry powders together, then, with clean hands and moist ones, press them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will produce a strange sensation and produce a sort of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets equipped with a flush system in almost all houses, connected to a sophisticated sewa
Found remains of sewer systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman times, public baths sometimes included toilets where men and women could mingle.
When you call someone who is thousands of kilometres away, you use a satellite.
The satellite receives the call in space and then returns it to Earth almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts a part of our light and our vision.
A giant rocket is required to put a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in many ways. The greatest advantage it has given us is that it has made transport much simpler and faster.
It has brought us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Underneath are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, including rabbits, deer and other cattle.
In addition, there are many small cats (including free-roaming cats) that eat small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a task specially devoted to each feline, preventing it from competing with other.
Lion cats are the most sociable cats, living in large groups called herds.
The packs are made up of one to three adult males, as well as a thirty-some females and cubs.
Women are generally very close to each other, their families being made up of a large number of sisters and daughters.
The lions' herds act like packs of wolves or dogs, animals which are remarkably similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in their behaviour, and also very deadly for their prey.
Balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (but sometimes very difficultly), swim, jump great distances and pull with five times the strength of a powerful human.
The tiger is part of the same family (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones capable of roaring.
The roar of the tiger does not sound like the roar of the lion, but rather like a phrase whose words would be cries and groans.
The ocelot is a voracious predator. It will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if it can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than him.
According to the scientists, ocelots hunt and find prey (prey) by smelling their tracks on the ground.
They see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision, and they move also very stealthily. The ocelots hunt their prey by blending into their environment before leaping on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it is derived (for example, if it moves above a mountain range or river, or if it moves to a new island so that it is not easily able to return to its former location), it often finds itself in a different environment than it was previously.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so that the new population will need new characteristics or adaptations to be a powerful competitor against what it had to do before.
The population of origin has not changed at all, it has always needed the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population adjusts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they will no longer be considered to belong to the same species.
We call this process "speciation", which simply means the formation of new species. The speciation is an inevitable and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, exhale).
Plants produce their food by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses and our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The giant squid was the superpredator of the time, it didn't fear anything, except other giant squid.
His long jaws were equipped with more than 70 sharp teeth, as well as a series of additional teeth in the palate, so that anything that crossed his path could not escape.
We don't know for sure, but it may have been a tongue-twister. His diet included turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been cannibal.
He attacked everything that entered the water; even a dinosaur like a T. rex was not up to the task.
Although the Romans ate food that we know, they ate strange or unusual dishes, including deer, pigeons, snails, and locusts, as well as the hare, a sort of rodent.
Another difference: while the poor and the woman ate their food sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to organize banquets where they rested on the side while they ate.
Roman meals of the ancient world could not include these foods that have been introduced into Europe centuries later.
For example, they did not have maize, tomatoes, or potatoes, nor cacao, and no Romans have ever tasted beef.
Babylonians built temples for each of their gods, which were regarded as the dwellings of the god.
People sacrificed to the gods and priests tried to meet the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had a courtyard, then a sacred inner sanctum to which only priests could access.
Sometimes, pyramidal temples were built as part of a temple.
The summit of the tower was a special place for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the home was not so important.
The bulk of the Jewish family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were open displays, giving onto the street. Houses were built of stone. 
As there were no large forests in Canaan, the wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In Scandinavian sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and found Greenland, and named it after him, in his travels further west.
But regardless of its discovery, the Eskimo people lived there already at the time.
While each country is 'Nordic', there are many differences between the people, the kings, the customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the film Benjamin Gates and the Templar Treasure, you may perhaps think that a treasure map has been drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that is not true. Although there is an inscription on the back of the document, it is not a treasure card.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, you could read the words 'Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776.' The document is on the bottom, facing up.
While no one is entirely sure who wrote it, we know that at an early stage of its existence, the great scroll (which measures approximately 29 inches three-quarters on 24 inches) was rolled up. 
It is therefore likely that the rating was added simply as an indication.
The landing day and the subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
She was governed by French collaborators, who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupying power instead of facing it.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies landed in southern France, an invasion called Operation "Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French had liberated the south of France and were heading for Germany.
A civilisation is a culture shared by a large number of people who live and work in cooperation, a society.
The word 'civilization' derives from the Latin word 'civis', which means 'citizen' and is related to the Latin words 'civitas', which means 'city' and'state' and also indicates, in some way, the size of the society to which it relates.
Cities-states are the pioneers of nations. A civilisational culture involves the transmission of knowledge on several generations, a durable cultural empreinte and a fair distribution of knowledge.
Minority cultures disappear often without leaving any historically relevant traces and are not recognised as genuine civilisations.
In the revolutionary war, the twelve states first formed a weak central government — the Congress being its only component — by virtue of the Articles of the Confederation.
The Congress did not have the power to impose taxes and, as there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on the authorities of the state, often less cooperative, to enforce its acts.
He had no power to derogate from tax laws or from customs laws between the Member States.
The articles required unanimous consent of all the Member States before they could be amended and Member States took the Central Government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, with Germany's national team, the second most successful team in the world and they have won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
In popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, equestrian, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1.
Skiing is the most popular sport in the North, Italians participating in international events and Olympic Games.
Japan has more than 7 000 islands (the largest being Honshu), which makes it the seventh-largest island in the world!
Because of the group of islands that it comprises, Japan is often referred to, geographically, as an 'archipelago'.
The first information about Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, while European sailors passing through it referred to it as Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the south-west of Taiwan, introducing a transformation of traditional practices of rice and sugar production, and employing Chinese labourers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coasts of Taiwan and declared it a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after his defeat during the first Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Treaty, by which it ceded Taiwan to Japan, which was then in charge of the island until 1945.
The Inca citadel is made up of three main structures: the Intihuatana, the sun temple and the three-window room.
Most of the neighbouring buildings have been rebuilt to provide better views of their original appearance.
In 1976, thirty percent of the Machu Picchu had been restored and this restoration continues to the present day.
For example, the most common format of photographic film is 35 mm; it was the most common format of film used in the late analogue era.
It is still made today, but what is important is that its image format is inherited from the format of the digital camera's sensor.
The 35 mm format is actually, and it’s quite surprising, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
So, we say that the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest of integer ratios) is 3:2.
Many common formats (APS family, for example) are equal to this aspect ratio or are close to it.
The third-party rule, which has been badly treated and often ridiculed, is a simple directive which stimulates dynamism while offering protection.
He indicates that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
In this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was being questioned.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has bound the European States together despite the differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power touched everyone, from the king to the peasants.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to relieve suffering and poverty and that the church's money is there specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church was in Rome for more than 1000 years and this concentration of power and money has led many people to wonder whether this doctrine was respected.
After the start of hostilities, Great Britain established a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategy has proved effective, cutting vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade has been in breach of internationally accepted and codified norms.
The United Kingdom is mining international waters to prevent ships from venturing into entire areas of the sea, thus representing a threat even for neutral ships.
As this tactic has not elicited a timid reaction, Germany expected a similar reaction to its underwater war without limits.
Over the past 20 years, most citizens and nations showed a preference for pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, nations have wished to prevent such a situation from recurring in the future.
In 1884, Tesla settled in the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four hundred dollars in his name, a poem and a recommendation letter from Charles Batchelor (his previous employer) to Thomas Edison.
China's ancient way of showing the different eras of China or each family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
Among each dynasty, there have also been periods of unstable provinces. The most well-known of these periods is the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty.
In these periods, fierce struggles took place between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms were one of the bloodiest periods in the history of Chinese history. Thousands of people died in battle to sit on the throne of the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political repercussions such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people and not to one single leader.
As well, after the Revolution, the jobs were opened to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and the most talented to succeed.
It is the same for the army, because the ranking of armies is no longer based on the class, but on the calibre.
The French Revolution also inspired many other working class people in other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions that transcended the world of this life. He used to frequent a cave that became famous under the name of "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived to the time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad’s spiritual inclinations.
Located at the top of one of the mountains in the north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find, even if we know that it exists. When we entered the cave, we were completely isolated.
Over there, you can only look up and see the clear blue sky and the many beautiful mountains surrounding it. From the inside of the cave, you can only see very little of this universe.
The Great Pyramid of Gizeh is the only of the Seven Wonders that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians during the third millennium BC, one of the many gigantic structures erected in honour of the Pharaohs who had died.
The Giza Plateau, or 'Giza Necropolis', in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, houses several pyramids (the largest being the most imposing), several small tombs, many temples and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honour the Pharaoh Khéops, and many smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honour his wives and family.
The symbol 'push' looks like a V and the symbol 'pull' looks like a staple or a square with a missing bottom.
The top means you must start with the tip and push the bow, and the bottom means you must start with the arrow (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the arrow.
A bow upwards produces a softer sound, while a bow downwards produces a louder sound.
Don't forget to write your own names on the pencil, but don't forget that the musical pencil marks are for a musical reason, and that you should therefore generally respect them.
On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, his two young children (Marie-Thérèse, eleven years old, and Louis-Charles, four years old), and the sister of the king, Madame Elisabeth, all terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of sellers.
In a carriage, they have returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who shout and scream threats against the king and the queen.
The king and queen were forced to open the windows of their carriages because of the crowd.
At a certain point, a crowd member brandished the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles before the terrified queen.
The US imperialist war expenditures in the Philippines have been paid by the people of the Philippines themselves.
They were forced to pay colonial American taxes to cover a large part of the expenses and interest of the Philippine government bonds issued by Wall Street banks.
Of course, the superprofits derived from prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people could constitute the fundamental benefits of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you need to understand the context in which they were created.
These events took place during the period generally considered to be the High Middle Ages – a period of history in Europe during the eleventh to thirteenth centuries (1000-1300).
The Middle Ages Central preceded the High Middle Ages and followed by the Low Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from the technological push or the imperative to a strict sense of which the destiny of humanity is determined by a logical underpinning linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies.
Many interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: technological development itself proceeds beyond cultural and political influences, and technological change has an impact on societies that are intrinsically conditioned rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we could say that the car industry is necessarily leading to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a few cars, so new methods of production are developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Massive ownership of cars also leads to an increased incidence of road accidents, which leads to the development of new techniques in the field of health care to treat the body injuries.
Romanticism presented an important cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
Romantic theories hold that geography has shaped individuals and, over time, customs and a culture associated with this geography have emerged. These, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris is known as the capital of the modern world of fashion, Constantinople was considered the capital of the medieval Europe.
His reputation as the centre of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until 1100 AD.
His status has declined over the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with presents such as silk and spices, which the Byzantine markets could not compete with.
It was in this period that the title of the capital of fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic architecture reached its peak between the 10th and 11th century and the 14th century.
At the beginning, the dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture, to the east.
However, due to the slowness of communication methods, Western modes could be behind by 25 to 30 years.
In the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time, following the Crusades, was the use of buttons for closing clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is an agricultural practice which is carried out to produce enough food for the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, often organic, using traditional seeds preserved from the region, combined with rotational farming or other simple techniques to maximise yield.
Historically, most farmers practised subsistence farming and it is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together people feeling neglected by the social norms and sharing the same ideas, which enables them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnic origin, class, location and / or sex of members.
The criteria that determine a subculture as distinct from the mainstream culture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
The members of a subculture often signal their membership by distinctive and symbolic use of style, which encompasses modes, maniérismes and slang.
One of the most common ways of illustrating the importance of socialization is to draw on a few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse, have not been socialized by adults during their childhood.
These children are considered to be "wild" or "savage". Some children were locked up by people (usually their own parents) ; in some cases, the abandonment of this child was due to the rejection of a severe intellectual or physical disability which the child suffered.
Wild children may have suffered serious abuse or trauma before being abandoned or escaping.
Others would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in the wild.
When they are raised entirely by non-human species, wild children display almost identical behaviours to those of the species that raised them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the support goes further.
Support is not a method of learning but rather a means of helping learners who discover a new teaching such as the use of a new programme or the start of a new project.
Supports can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but the little Microsoft Office guy is also one.
Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are intended to guide, explain and guide students through procedures that could have been too difficult to manage by themselves.
Children are placed in foster care for very diverse reasons which include neglect, extortion, and even child abuse.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, attentive and educational, but that is the case.
We perceive the family placement system as a safe zone for these children.
Our family placement system is supposed to provide safe, loving homes, stable education and reliable healthcare.
Placement in foster care is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were previously removed.
Internet combines mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approach to use and rewards.
For example, 'learning' and'socialization' are seen as major factors favouring Internet use (James et al., 1995).
'Personal involvement' and 'continuous relationships' have also been identified as being new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied the public reactions to Internet sites.
Video recording has led to great discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, which are facial expressions for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect if a person is lying by interpreting correctly micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, has indicated how people with brain damage are able to assess the sincerity of the speech.
He even suggests that such capacities for human behaviour interpretation may be found in domestic dogs.
The research of the twentieth century has shown that there are two genetic reservoirs: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and the selection removes it from the gene pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination alternate between the two basins at each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet its nutritional needs from the available plant resources.
In addition, a lack of response has serious consequences: growth problems, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The most easily accessible plant proteins would be those contained in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult to digest for us, unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal-based foodstuffs (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest and provide a large amount of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
In all fairness, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors have solved their 'protein problem' in a similar way that chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentional waking during your sleep and subsequently falling back to sleep (from 10 to 60 minutes).
This can be done relatively easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock so that you wake up without waking up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock during your sleep, it may be placed on the other side of the room, making it difficult to get out of bed to turn it off.
The other possibilities based on the biorhythm include drinking a lot of liquids before going to bed (especially water or tea, reputed to be diuretics), which forces you to wake up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace of a person is opposed to the degree of tension in his or her body and mind.
When the tension is low, the present vital force is positive. Each person has the opportunity to find peace and absolute contentment.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been enriched by the path of mahayana love and by many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (illumination energy) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The Tibetan center of meditation is the yoga of the deity. It is through visualization of different deities that the channels of energy are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of awakening is created.
Germany was a common enemy during the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, deep conflicts between their different systems, methods and cultures ended the entente between these two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the old allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for 40 years and see real conflicts, through proxy armies, on battlefields as well in Africa as in Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian front.
But these plans were obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800 000 Soviet troops arrived and created the Bieloruss and Ukrainian fronts after invading the east of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, as well as other international treaties, be they bilateral or multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient way of moving large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The work of the armed forces has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the capacity to move your people and your property, while interfering with your enemy's capacity to move its people and property.
One of the most recent examples of this situation was the North Atlantic campaign during the Second World War. The Americans were trying to cross the Atlantic Ocean to help the British.
At the same time, the German Navy, using mainly U-Boats, tried to stop this trade.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as it has done for the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were domesticated for the first time about 10, 000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
The cultures and tribes of old began to keep them close to them to have easy access to milk, wool, meat and skins.
Domestic sheep were usually kept in flocks that wandered on hills or other pasture areas, often cared for by shepherds who were most often children or adolescents, similar to the more familiar term of shepherds.
The 'wagonways' were built in England in the 16th century.
While the railway tracks were simply made of parallel planks of wood, they allowed horses to pull them to greater speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the slightly more accident-prone roads of the day.
The crossbars were introduced fairly early to keep the tracks in place. However, it was soon realised that the tracks would be more effective if they were equipped with a steel bar on top.
It has become a common practice, but the iron has caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first iron rails were introduced.
The first means of locomotion was walking: humans began to walk upright about two million years ago with the arrival of the Homo Erectus ("right-handed man").
Their predecessors, the australopithecines, did not walk upright as they usually did.
There are bipedal specializations in fossils of Australopithecus afarensis from 4,2 to 3,9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs already seven million years ago.
We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be involved in the fight against the suffering that is to come.
In many cases, it is a symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not just want a temporary solution, we have to find the root of the problems and disable them.
It is clear that the world has changed greatly thanks to the advances in science and technology made by human beings, and that the problems have become more complex because of the overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
After its adoption by Congress on 4 July, a manuscript signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to a few blocks away, to the printing office of John Dunlap.
At night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, known as "Dunlap Broadsides.
The public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the Independence Hall on 8 July.
One of them was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who read it to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy reached London on 10 August.
The 25 sheets Dunlap that are known to exist are the oldest copies of the document. The original manuscript has not survived.
Many palaeontologists today believe that a dinosaur group survived and is still alive. They are called birds.
Many people regard them as dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly.
But there are still a lot of things that look like dinosaurs.
They have scales on their feet and claws, they lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information which are encoded in binary form.
A binary number can have only one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary numbers, or bits to use the computer jargon.
An internal poisoning can not be seen immediately. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are sufficiently general to allow a diagnosis to be made immediately.
The best indicator of an internal poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of toxic household chemicals or medicines.
Look at the label to find out the specific first aid instructions for this poison.
The term 'insect' is used by entomologists in a formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
The term derives from an old familiarity with bed bugs, which are very adapted to parasitize humans.
The flies, like bed bugs, are nymphs, which means they are adapted to live in the nest or habitat of their host.
In the United States, there are about 400 000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which makes it the principal neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, consisting of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have MS than men.
A couple can very well estimate that it is not in their interest, nor in the child's interest, to take care of the child's education.
These couples can choose to make a baby adoption plan.
In the context of adoption, biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main objective of science is to understand how the world works by scientific method. This method guides in fact most scientific research.
But it is not the only, experimentation, and an experiment is a test that serves to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, pose questions and make observations, but it also orients scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers have focused on ancient texts, and in particular on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's opinions on all scientific questions, including psychology, have been accepted.
With the decline of Greek knowledge, Western civilisation has been cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed physiological and behavioural rhythms are often dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to periodic stimuli, have been found for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Organic clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to operate for a certain period even without external stimulation.
The experience of Hershey and Chase was one of the main indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacteria.
They have conducted two experiments to mark the DNA of the phage with a radioactive phosphorus, or the protein of the phage with a radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the extent of the mutated material, and whether the mutated cells are germ cells.
Only germline mutations can be passed on to children, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism is of interest to those who wish to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, in particular wildlife and flora.
Hunting, fishing, bird watching, photography, park visits, and studying the information on the ecosystem are examples of activities on the ground.
You can, for example, go to see, photograph and discover the orang-utans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small towns in the countryside by car to go to their place of work and cross other people who are going to work in the country they have just left.
In this dynamic, dynamic bus service, everyone is in some way connected to a private car-based transport system and supports it.
The science now shows that this massively carbon-based economy has pushed the biosphere out of its stable state which has supported human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about the quality of water or collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they break down every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flows are the study of the movements of drivers and private vehicles between two points, and the interactions they exercise between themselves.
It is difficult to study the flow of traffic because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with 100 per cent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act within a reasonable range; so, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically in a rough way.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) the flow, (2) the density and (3) the speed.
These relationships help to plan, design and operate road infrastructures.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly made it easier for them to escape from their enemies and find more effectively food and companions.
Among insects, most have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their bodies.
It gives them more places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and the ephemerals.
A few thousand years ago, a man called Aristotle asserted that the solar system moved around the sun.
Many people thought he was right, but many others believed the opposite: that the solar system moved around the earth, including the sun (and even the other stars).
It seems reasonable, because the Earth does not seem to move, is it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times the volume of water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the world's largest river, reaching up to 10 km wide.
About 20% of the water that falls from rivers in the world into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main branch of the Amazon River is 6 387 km (3 980 miles). It collects the water from thousands of small rivers.
While the construction of pyramids continued up to the end of the Ancient Egyptian Empire, the Great Pyramid of Giza has never been surpassed in size and the technical excellence of its construction.
Ancien Egyptians were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, who had then been in existence for more than a thousand years.
The Vatican has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and the least populated.
The Vatican City is writing its legislation and official communications in Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
The citizens of the Vatican City are all Catholics.
From antiquity, people have been familiar with the basic elements of the chemical world, such as gold, silver and copper, because they are found in nature in the form of raw materials and are relatively simple to mine using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, has theorised that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. It was earth, water, air and fire.
It was more of a four-state-of-the-matter (in the same order) : solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although he also expressed the theory that these would transform into new substances to form what we see.
alloys are mainly a mixture of two metals or more. Remember that the periodic table contains a large number of elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered as metals. Of course, there are also metals such as gold and silver.
There are also alloys that contain a small amount of non-metal elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of minuscule particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that billions of them could enter into the period at the end of this sentence.
So, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it was released.
Unfortunately, the emergence of new modes of writing has marginalized the pen to a more private status and to less frequent uses.
People now write messages on computers screens, without ever having to get near a pencil.
It is only natural to wonder what the keyboard will become when the next new thing comes along.
The fission reactor works on the principle that it transforms energy by combining a nucleus of a myriad of protons and neutrons.
Like if you were to make a hill climb by dragging a heavy cart up a hill.
Some atoms have a volatile nucleus, so they tend to break up with little or no pressure.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust. Its outer layer is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the visible side and 100 km on the hidden side.
It is finer at sea level and thicker under the continents.
There may be more lava on the side close to the volcano because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are focused on the search for what makes people feel good or attracted.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they matured into adulthood.
These theories examine what motivates some people to want what they do and what, in their environment, prompts them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and the two-factor theory of Herzberg.
Generally speaking, two behaviours can emerge when a manager becomes the boss of former colleagues. At one end of the spectrum, being the good friend (or the good friend) is a common response. At the other end, there
This kind of manager has a hard time taking unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary actions, conducting evaluations, giving people responsibility, and holding others accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, one becomes a person who is unrecognizable, who feels that he/she must change everything that the group has created up to now and do things his/her way.
After all, the boss is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behaviour often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same high standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual teams often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical team.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet at different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a real "invisible" team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
The "invisible" team is the team of management to which each member reports. It sets the standards for each of them.
Why would an organisation want to create a structure for learning? One of the objectives of the implementation of organisational learning concepts is innovation.
When all the available resources are used efficiently in a functional service, creativity and ingenuity can be fully expressed.
Thus, a process of working together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovative process to meet the customer's need.
Before an organisation can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and its own learning culture.
Angel (2006) describes Continuum as a method used to help organisations achieve better results.
Neurobiological data provide material evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research. They allow researchers to reduce the field of research and to make it much more precise.
Correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research.
We know for a long time that different types of damage, lesions, tumours and brain trauma affect the behaviour and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The development of new technologies has enabled us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
It gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although Artificial Intelligence is often strongly connoted science-fiction, it represents a very important part of computer science that studies intelligent behaviour, learning and adaptation.
Artificial intelligence research aims at automating tasks requiring a systematic approach.
In addition to the examples mentioned above, there are the control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnostics and customer questions, as well as recognition of writing, voice and face.
This practice has led to separate disciplines, oriented towards the provision of solutions to everyday problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and military affairs, as it was put into practice in several home computer software and video games.
Excursions are an integral part of any school. Often, a teacher would like to take his pupils to places where a bus journey is not possible.
The solution is provided by the technology in the form of virtual educational excursions. Students can view ancient objects from a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a beautiful work of art while sitting in their classroom.
Participating practically to a trip is also an excellent way of thinking about a trip and of sharing your experiences with future generations.
For example, students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design each year a website dedicated to their visit to the state capital. Each year, the website is updated, but the old versions are kept online for use as an album.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Even if students often try blogging with poor grammar and spelling, having a public audience usually makes the situation better.
As students are often the most critical public, the author of the blog is beginning to try to improve his writing so as to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging "forces students to better know the world around them." The need to stimulate public interest encourages students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are an effective tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning well beyond the traditional school day.
When used well, blogs can help students to strengthen their analytical and critical thinking skills: by responding actively to online content, they can confront their own opinion to that of others and to express their own viewpoints on specific topics.
Ottawa is the charming capital of Canada and boasts a large number of art galleries and museums that showcase the past and present of Canada.
You will find more south the falls of Niagara and north, the region of Muskoka and its environs which possess a virgin natural beauty.
All these measures, and many more, make Ontario what foreigners regard as the quintessence of Canada.
A large part of the northern regions are sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited at the wild state.
For a more surprising comparison of the population: There are more African-Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean, close to the African coast.
Madagascar is the largest country, and even a continent by itself, in terms of animal life.
Many of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known for being luxury beach resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam into the land and this religion spread widely to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route linking Europe to India.
North, the region is defined by the Sahara Desert, and to the south and east by the Atlantic Ocean.
To women: It is recommended that any woman who travels say that she is married, irrespective of her marital status.
It is also advisable to wear an alliance (which should not seem too precious.
Women must realise that some cultural differences can lead to behaviours that they regard as harassment. It is, indeed, common that they are followed, caught by the arm, etc.
Be firm in your refusal of advances from men, and don't be afraid to hold your ground (cultural differences or not, it does not mean it's acceptable!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Ptolemies, the Romans and the Merovingians as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese, who after destroying it had rebuilt it and named it Casa Branca, finally abandoned it in 1755 after a major earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city under the name of Daru l-Badya, and it was renamed Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in all of Morocco for shopping.
Around the old medina, you can easily find places where you can buy traditional Moroccan products, such as tajines, pottery, leather goods, nargilehs and all sorts of bibelots, but that's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city centre.
Goma is reasonably secure, but any visit to the outside of Goma must be subject to investigation to understand the state of the fighting in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of Nyiragongo volcano as well as for trekking gorillas in the mountains among the least expensive in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motor taxi) to get around in Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 CFA francs for a short journey.
Combined with its relative remoteness, "Tombouctou" has become a metaphor for distant and exotic countries.
Today, Tombouctou is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the World Heritage List in Danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main steps in the emission " Wonders of the African World " by Henry Louis Gates on PBS.
The town contrasts greatly with the rest of the country, because it has a more Arab style than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and runs along the Mozambique border to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The total area of the park is 19 500 km2, which is divided into 14 ecozones, each housing a specific fauna.
This is one of the most famous South African National Parks and regarded as the jewel in the SANParks crown.
As for all South African national parks, there are daily entry fees and conservation rights in place.
It may be advantageous to obtain a Wild Card that allows access to some South African national parks, as well as all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is named after the territory of Hong Kong and represents the main centre of interest for many tourists.
The row of skyscrapers that forms the horizon of Hong Kong was compared to a glittering bar chart, which is reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To admire the most beautiful panoramas of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to Kowloon's seafront located opposite.
The vast majority of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the northern side of the harbour.
This is the place that the British occupied. Thus, it seems to me to be a good starting point, if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this region.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest mangrove forest belt, extending for 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the back-country of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located on Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not only made up of mangrove swamps: they also contain some of the last vestiges of the majestic jungles that covered the plains of the Ganges once.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3 850 km2, of which around one third is covered by water/wetlands.
Sundarbans is a nature reserve since 1966, you will find there about 400 Bengal tigers and about 30 000 striped hyenas.
Buses leave the district bus station (located on the other side of the river) throughout the day, but most, especially those that serve the east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6 and 7 am.
Inter-city buses are often full, so it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese ferries which are comfortable and robust.
The shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to get to places nearby, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock Bridge is a suspension bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to link the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint George in Guyana.
The two towers are 83 metres high, it is 378 metres long and has two 3,50 m wide lanes.
The vertical displacement under the bridge is 15 metres. The structure was completed in August 2011, but it was opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge should be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs posts will be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group living in what is now the eastern part of Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also practising subsistence agriculture.
Other indigenous tribes who populated the Chaco, such as the Guaycurú or the Payaguá, survived mainly by fishing, hunting, or gathering.
In the sixteenth century, Paraguay, once called 'the vast province of India', was born of the meeting between Spanish conquerors and indigenous people.
The Spanish inaugurated the period of colonization, which lasted three centuries.
From the foundation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain a large part of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best teams and among the best players in polo in the world.
The biggest polo tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
In addition, smaller tournaments and matches are sometimes organised here at other times of the year.
For information on polo tournaments and where to buy tickets, see the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Isle of Man is the Manx pound (FKP) which is equivalent to a pound sterling (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island of Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
The pound sterling is a widely accepted currency in the islands, while in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the nearby islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, even if it is possible that the British and American dollars will be accepted. Talk to the owners in advance about a payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange money from the Isle of Man outside of the islands, so change it before you leave the islands.
Montevideo being located in the south of the Equator, winter in the northern hemisphere corresponds to summer there and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical zone and summer temperatures exceeding 30°C are common.
Winter can be misleadingly cold: temperatures rarely fall below zero, but wind and humidity combine to give the impression that it is colder than what the thermometer says.
There are no 'rainy' and 'dry' seasons: the rainfall is pretty constant all year round.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, they are still wild animals; please do not feed them or disturb them.
According to the authorities of the park, you must be at least 100 metres away from wolves and bears and at least 25 metres away from all other wild animals!
As docile as they may appear, the bison, the elk, the moose, the wolf and almost all the great animals can attack.
Every year, hundreds of visitors are injured because they did not keep a sufficient distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them some space.
In addition, know that odours attract wild animals, so avoid transporting or cooking odours-producing foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of about 40 000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and is the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a tragic naval standoff in 1889, when seven German, American and British ships refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
The Supreme Head of the Mau Movement Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was assassinated during a peaceful gathering that was taking place in the city, during the struggle for independence organized by the Mau Movement
The beaches are numerous, because Auckland is located on two ports. The most popular ones are located in three zones.
The North Shore beaches are on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay north to Devonport south.
Most beaches are sandy and allow safe bathing, and most are shaded by the Pohutukawa.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the chic suburb of Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in the centre of Auckland.
These beaches, sometimes very popular with families, have many shops along the coast. Swimming is safe there.
The main local beer is the "Number One", a rather ordinary beer, but tasty and refreshing. There is also another local beer, the "Manta".
There are many French wines to taste, but New Zealand and Australian wines will travel better.
You can drink tap water without any risk, but you can easily find bottled water if you have any concerns about it.
For Australians, the idea of a 'coffee cream' is foreign. A short black is an 'espresso', a cappuccino is filled with cream (no mousse) and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is Belgian standard compliant. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many voyages on the reef are carried out throughout the year, and injuries caused by one of these causes on the reef are rare.
However, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signs and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
From October to April, north of 1770, the box jellyfish arrive near beaches and estuary rivers. They can also sometimes be seen outside of this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most of them are afraid of humans and would run away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live in active water, their main habitat is in estuarine rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveller the peace of mind that he will have somewhere to sleep once he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but you can also book accommodation through travel agencies of other types, such as camping sites.
Travel agencies usually offer packages including breakfast, airport transfers or even packages combining flights and accommodation.
They can also hold your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or to procure other documents necessary for your destination (for example, a visa).
Any modification or request must be addressed to the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants decide to camp on site, and most consider that this is an integral part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the musical event, you will have to arrive early to find a good camping site.
Don't forget that even if the music concerts are over on the main stages, other music concerts can continue until late at night on other sites of the festival.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the Baltic Sea in winter, be sure to check the location of the hut, because the crossing of the ice can cause unbearable noises at the most exposed huts.
Cruises to St Petersburg include time spent in the city. Passengers on cruises are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos generally make a great deal of effort to maximise the time and money spent by their customers. There are rarely windows and clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They generally offer special offers of food, drinks and entertainment in order to keep the guests' spirits up and keep them there.
On some sites, it is the premises that offer free alcoholic beverages. However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good players should know that it is crucial to remain sober.
Anyone who travels to high latitudes or crosses mountains must consider the possibility of snow, ice or cold temperatures.
On the icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you cannot drive like you are on the asphalt.
In the blizzards, it can fall very quickly enough snow to block you.
The visibility can also be limited by snowfall or snowdrifts or by condensation or frost on the windows of vehicles.
On the other hand, the presence of ice and snow is normal in many countries, and the road network is practically continuous all year round.
Safaris are perhaps the most popular tourist attraction in Africa and the most memorable moment for many visitors.
Safari" is a term used in everyday language to refer to an African excursion, and in particular to the savannah, where the spectacle of wild animals in their natural environment is spectacular.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach close to cars and standard equipment allows them to be observed.
Lion, cheetah and leopards are sometimes timid and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as 'walking in the bush', 'walking safari' or 'footing') consists of walking, either for a few hours, or for several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, after hosting the Games in 1964.
If you have booked your flights and accommodation in 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you are likely to be in a difficult position.
The policies of cancellation vary, but from mid-March, most of the cancellation policies based on the coronavirus do not extend to July 2020, the date on which the Olympics were to have been held.
We expect that most events tickets will cost between 2 500 and 130 000 yens, typical tickets costing about 7 000 yens.
Wringing out wet clothes can make them dry more quickly. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards that can be loaned, even if there is no iron in the room. 
If you do not have a iron or do not want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if you find one.
Avoid overheating the fabric (which can cause shrinkage or in extreme cases, burn it).
There are various methods of water purification, including some that are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it is enough to boil water for a minute; in others, it is necessary to boil it for several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you have a problem, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter dangerous animals that they do not know in their home region.
Parasites can contaminate food, cause irritations or, in the most serious cases, cause allergic reactions, spread venom or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can cause harm to or kill people by force, are not usually considered parasites.
In some localities, duty free shops present an opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and duties.
Travellers to destinations where taxes are high can sometimes save a great deal of money, in particular on alcoholic drinks or tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh interstate, passing frequently through isolated backcountry areas of the hinterland.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your eyes open: steep gradients, narrow roads and tight curves predominate.
Speed limits displayed are significantly lower than in previous sections – usually between 35 and 40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and stricter compliance is still more important than before.
On the other hand, the mobile phone service is surprisingly much stronger here than on many other parts of the road, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cakes are rather good, and in Bavaria, they are very rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbour, Austria.
Fruit cakes are a common feature of the season: apples are baked and cooked in cakes all year round, while pears and plums are on the point of appearing in the summer.
German breads also contain nuts, almonds and other nuts. Popular cakes often go well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but tasty cakes, try Berliners, also known as Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region.
A curry is a dish made up of herbs and spices, accompanied by meat or vegetables.
A curry dish can be'solid' or 'liquid', depending on the amount of sauce it contains. 
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in the south of India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesia having 17 000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines present in all the country.
However, when this term is used without any other qualifying term, it tends to refer to food produced in the central and eastern parts of the island of Java.
Now, widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a wide range of simple dishes, the predominant flavours being the cacao pods, chillies, sugar (especially the coconut sugar of Java) and various aromatic spices.
Horseshoes are used to support the feet of the rider, who hang from each side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability to the user, but they can pose a security problem: for example, the user's feet can get trapped in the footrests.
If a rider is thrown from a horse, but has a leg caught in the stirrup, he could be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimise this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a flat sole and a narrow heel.
In addition, some horses, particularly English, have safety bars which allow a rider to fall off the saddle if the rider is pulled backward by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley – The Chilean climbing destination of excellence, known as the Yosemite of South America, with many different granite faces and cliffs.
From the top of the mountains, the panoramas are unparalleled. The alpinists of the world over are discovering new routes practicable on the slopes, where the possibilities are limitless. 
Skiing downhill, in particular skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down a snowy slope with skis or snowboards attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity which has many fans, sometimes called'ski bums', who organise their entire holidays around skiing in specific places.
The idea of skiing is very ancient: paintings of caves showing skiers date for some of 5 000 years ago!
Skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 16th century; the first ski club in a leisurely form was founded in 1861 in Australia by Norwegians. 
Mountaineering skiing: this activity is also called Nordic skiing, cross-country skiing or mountaineering skiing. 
It looks like alpine skiing, as well as alpinism, but without, however, incorporating in general these activities, which are practiced on uneven terrains and which require the use of skis and boots much stiffer.
Think of skiing as a similar hiking route.
In good conditions, you can walk a little further than you can on foot – but you will rarely reach the speeds of skiing without a heavy pack on a muddy slope.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but containing many independent countries. In classic circumstances, travelling through several countries involves the need to apply for several visas and to undergo several passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, works a little like one country in this regard.
As long as you remain within this area, you can usually cross the borders without having to go through passport controls.
In addition, having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply separately for each of the Member States of the Schengen area, which means that you can save time, money and administrative procedures.
There is no universal definition of an antique, and some tax authorities define objects over 100 years old as antiquities.
The conditions vary according to where one is located; in some parts of the world, such as in North America, the age limit can be lower than that in force in Europe.
Artisanal products can be considered as antiquities even if they are less ancient than similar industrial products.
Reindeer herding is a means of subsistence for Samis and the culture surrounding this trade has great importance for many other professions.
Although, according to tradition, all Samis have not been involved in large-scale reindeer herding, they lived off fishing, hunting and other similar activities, and used reindeer mainly as livestock.
Today, many Samis practice modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Lapland, the Sami region.
While widely used, in particular among non-Romas, the term 'Gitan' is often considered to be pejorative because of its association with negative stereotypes and an unfair image of the Roma people.
If the country in which you are going to be affected by a travel warning issued by your government, your health insurance abroad or your travel cancellation insurance can be affected.
You can also use the advice of other governments than your own, but their advice is tailored to their citizens.
As an example, US citizens in the Middle East could be faced with different situations from those faced by Europeans or Arabs.
Advices are only a brief summary of the political situation of a country.
The opinions presented are often superficial, general and too simplified in relation to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Violent weather is the generic term for any meteorological phenomenon that can cause damage, social disruption or loss of life.
Unfavourable weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and they can be of several kinds, depending on geographical, topographical and meteorological characteristics.
Violent winds, hail, excessive precipitation and fires are forms and effects of violent weather, just as tornadoes, hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons are.
Extreme weather phenomena, regional and seasonal, include cold weather, snowstorms with violent winds, and sandstorms or dust storms.
It is strongly recommended that travellers check the weather forecast for their destination region, knowing that it may have an impact on their travel plans.
Anyone considering travelling to a country which could be considered a war zone should receive vocational training.
A search on the Internet for "Cours in hostile environment" will probably provide the address of a local company.
A course will cover the topics covered here in much more detail, usually with a practical experience.
A training usually lasts for 2 to 5 days and includes role playing, lots of first aid, and sometimes a training in the use of weapons.
Wildlife books and magazines are common, but war-zone publications are scarce.
Travellers planning to undergo a gender reassignment abroad should ensure that they have valid travel documents for their return journey.
The governments' desire to issue passports with the sex not indicated (X) or to update documents to correspond to the desired name and sex varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honour these documents is as variable as the weather.
Security checkpoint searches have become much more intrusive in the era of post-11 September 2001.
Transsexual people in the pre-op phase should not be expected to undergo the scans in order to preserve their privacy and dignity.
Storm surges are the surges that return from the waves breaking on the beach, often on a reef or equivalent.
Because of the underwater topography, the return flow is concentrated on a few deeper sections, and a fast flow to the deep waters can form.
In most cases, deaths are caused by exhaustion resulting from trying to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you leave the current, the return to swimming is not more difficult than it is usually.
You may try to aim at a place where you will not be taken again. It is also possible that, depending on your skills and whether you have been spotted or not, you may want to wait for help.
The cultural shock occurs earlier than the economic shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer and is more severe.
Travelers who have had a hard time adjusting to the new culture have sometimes a lot of trouble adjusting to their home culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and have lost some of your native culture.
At first, when you travelled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travellers in a new country must adapt.
People may not be anticipating that patience and understanding are also necessary for travellers and travellers returning home.
The light and sound show at the Pyramid is one of the most interesting attractions in the region for children.
You can see the pyramids in the darkness and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
Often, you hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The history of sound and light is like a history book.
The Sphinx is placed as the backdrop and the narrator of a long history.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and different pyramids are lit.
The Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the largest number of research stations, and 16 of them are active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the mainland. The island of King George, with the village of Villa Las Estrellas, is the largest.
Other examples: Livingston Island and the Deception, where the still active caldera of a volcano offers a spectacular natural harbour.
Ellsworth Land is the southern part of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, then reappear to form the Ellsworth Range, which is 360 km long and traversed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, contains the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which stands at 4892 m.
In remote areas without cellular network, you may not have other choice than to use satellite telephony.
A satellite phone does not replace a mobile phone, because you need to be outside and have a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
It is a service often used by navigation, including pleasure craft, as well as by expeditions that require data transmission at distance and telephony.
Your local telephone company should be able to tell you more about this service.
Those who plan a year off have the opportunity to learn by travelling, and more and more of them are choosing this option.
This is particularly popular with young people who leave school, because it allows them to take a year off before university, without compromising their studies.
Often, having taken a year off to study abroad can actually give you better chances of going on to study at university in your own country.
As a rule, you have to pay enrolment fees to take these educational programmes.
Finland is a popular destination for sailing. The "Land of the thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, in lakes and archipelagos on the coast.
You do not necessarily need a yacht in the archipelago and on lakes.
While the coastal and large lakes are actually quite large for a yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden and New Zealand are in the same position, but apart from that, it is a unique case (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one to forty).
Most cruises on the Baltic Sea last for several days in St. Petersburg, Russia.
That means you can visit the historic city for a few days, all the while sleeping on the boat at night.
If you do not travel by airplane to the ground, you will not need a separate visa from 2009 onwards.
Berlin, in Germany, is mentioned in some brochures for cruises. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not at all located near the sea and no visit to this city is included in the cruise price. 
Travelling by air can be a terrifying experience for all ages and from all backgrounds, particularly if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It is not shameful: it is not different from the fears and fears of personal things that many people experience in relation to other things.
To some, understanding something about the workings of aircraft and what happens during a flight can help to overcome a fear which is based on the unknown or on the fact that you do not have control.
The companies that provide fast delivery are well paid to do so. Often, in an urgent repair, the question of time is crucial for documents, goods or spare parts that relate to them.
On some routes, large companies have their own aircraft, but on other routes and for small companies, there has been a problem.
If they had shipped goods by air freight, on some routes, it would have taken days to clear customs and to unload the cargo.
The only way to do this was to send it as registered baggage. The airline regulations will not allow them to send an unaccompanied bag, and that's where you come in.
The easiest way to travel first class or business class is to pay a large sum of money for this privilege (or, better still, ask your company to do it for you).
However, that is not cheap: in general, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class, and eleven times for first class!
Generally, it is pointless to seek to obtain reduced seats in business or first class on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that they can count on certain types of passengers who are willing to pay very high prices for the privileges of speed and comfort, and they set their fares knowingly.
The capital of the Republic of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is very common.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that is suffering from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, with its own government and currency, but recognized by no member of the United Nations.
The economic links between these two parts of the Moldavian Republic have been restored despite the failure of the political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is the Orthodox Christianity.
With a population of 3.7 million, İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey, the second port after Istanbul, and a good platform for correspondence.
The ancient city of Smyrna is today a modern commercial centre, developed and vibrant, located around an enormous bay, surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, the glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping centres are dotted with traditional red tiled roofs, the old market hall of the 17th century, and old mosques and churches, although the city has a Mediterranean atmosphere which reminds more of Europe than the traditional Turkish city.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the neighbouring island of Eysturoy and houses an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, there are interesting marble sculptures depicting doves on some graves.
It is worth walking around for half an hour in this fascinating village.
The romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, located north, is easily accessible and has been made famous to foreigners by the vivid account of its splendour that it has made by Lord Byron.
The bus 403 of Scotturb travels regularly to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
When you visit the north, don't miss the beautiful Fatima Shrine (temple), a place of worldwide fame for the apparitions of Mary.
Don't forget that you are visiting a mass grave, as well as a site that has a very significant meaning for a significant proportion of the world's population.
There are still many people alive who have survived their stay here, and many others who have seen their loved ones murdered or killed by forced labour, Jews or not Jews, regardless of their religion.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Don't make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Don't ruin the site by defacing or scratching graffiti on the structures.
Barcelona's official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, a large majority understands it, and most people are able to speak Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, because the law establishes that it is the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan, but unforeseen disruptions are announced by an automated system in many languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
The Parisians are known for being egocentric, greedy and arrogant.
While this stereotype is often inaccurate, the best way to get along in Paris is to behave well, act like someone of good manners. This will greatly facilitate your travels.
The abrupt exteriors of Parisians disappear quickly if you show the very minimum of courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely wooded, mainly of beech, pine and oak, and presents a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
The country has a great variety of plant communities because of the diversity of its microclimates, soils and altitudes.
The region also houses a very large variety of animal and bird species.
Animals such as the European brown bear, wolf, owl, lynx, wild cat and the great tit can be seen there, as well as many common species.
When they visit a monastery, women must cover their knees and cover their shoulders as well.
Most monasteries provide shawls to women who arrive without anything, but if you bring your own shawl and that shawl is brightly coloured, you will be given a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
As men should wear trousers covering their knees.
You can also borrow this item from the rack at the entrance, but as it is not washed after each use, it is possible that you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. A single size for men!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (mainly pork), and relies on olive oil.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato and all the condiments available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All names, followed by the word Sie which means you, always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
It is a good way of distinguishing between some verbs and objects.
It can also be said that it facilitates reading, although the writing is somewhat complicated by the need to know whether a verb or an adjective is used substantively.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to watch out for are the c and g, because their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Please also ensure that you pronounce 'r' and 'rr' distinctly: 'caro' means 'dear', while 'carro' means 'cart'.
Persian has a relatively easy grammar and most of the time regular.
As a result, reading this introduction to Persian grammar would help you to learn a lot about Persian grammar and to better understand the phrases.
It goes without saying that if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, those who speak a little Spanish might conclude prematurely that the Portuguese is sufficiently close to Spanish to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are generally outdated today, and remain in place as museums or educational sites.
Firstly, the light pollution of the time was not as serious as it is today, and they are usually located in cities or on campus, easier to access than those built in the modern era.
Modern astronomical telescopes are enormous infrastructures placed in remote areas where the conditions are favourable.
Hanami, the Japanese tradition of viewing the cherry blossoms, is a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where plum blossoms were the favourite flower.
In Japan, the first Cherry Blossom Festivals were organised by the Emperor only for himself and his close circle of courtiers around the Imperial Palace.
Plants are their most beautiful when they are in a natural environment, resist the temptation to take just one.
If you visit a garden strictly designed, the collection of "specimens" will also throw you out without discussion.
Singapore is generally regarded as a very safe place, where it is very easy to move around, and where you can buy almost everything you need once you arrive there.
But, located in the "high latitudes", only a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to adapt to the heat (always) and strong sunlight (when the sky is clear, which is rarer).
There are also some buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Check that the bus you are considering taking will take you to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiriya Arba.
Inland waterways can be a great theme for holidays.
For example, visit castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or take a cruise along the Erie Canal.
They also define the routes for hiking trails and popular cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important Christian festivals, it celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Many traditions associated with these festivals have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-believers throughout the world.
It is customary to sleep out in the open on Easter morning to see the sunrise.
There are certainly Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be that it is a pre-Christian spring ritual.
Traditional churches often hold a vigil on Easter Saturday night during the Easter weekend, often breaking into the party at midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All animals who arrived on these islands originated by water, swimming or by air.
Because of the great distance between them and the continent, the giant tortoise has been the main animal of pasture for the Galapagos islands.
From the arrival of man to the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including cattle, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the arctic or antarctic regions in winter, you will be able to see the polar night, during which the sun does not rise above the horizon.
It is a good opportunity to admire the auroras, because the sky will be dark almost all day.
As the regions are sparsely populated, and that light pollution is not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than that which Westerners can be accustomed to.
The costumes are classic workwear, and employees are referred to by their family name or by their job title.
Workplace harmony is crucial, because it places the emphasis on collective rather than individual achievements.
Workers must often obtain the agreement of their superiors for any decision they take and are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without asking questions.
