It confirms not only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already very widespread, but provides details that the fossils cannot usually provide, such as the colour and the three-dimensional arrangement of the feathers.
Scientists say that this bird's plumage was brown on top and pale or carotened on the bottom.
This discovery also helps us to understand the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a fully developed root, but show other characteristics of feathers – beards and barbules – the researchers concluded that the root was probably an evolutionary development later on.
The plumage structure suggests that they were not used in flight, but rather for display or temperature regulation. The researchers suggested that even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not the feathers of a chick.
The scientists say that this is certainly the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, but the sample reveals a feather belonging to an adult, not a juvenile.
A car bomb exploded at the headquarters of the police in Gaziantep, Turkey, this morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.

The assistant inspector general D. K. Arya said: "We have arrested five people for violating the Swiss citizen, and we have recovered her mobile phone and laptops.
The accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
The police commissioner said that the accused had been covered up when they appeared before the court.
While three people were present in the house when the car crashed into it, no one was injured.
However, the driver was badly injured to the head.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed to allow rescue services to extract the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son by the Sheriff Court of Edinburgh.
She is in custody awaiting trial, but eyewitness testimony could be compromised because her portrait has been widely circulated.
This is a standard practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but the Scottish courts operate differently and they have considered that publishing photos was potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, of Dundee University, notes that "the journalists seem to be following a dangerous line if they publish photos, etc. of suspects.
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is responsible for the entire case, has said that no further comment will be made at least until the prosecution is brought.
According to the leak, the document will deal with the dispute at the border that the Palestinians claim on the basis of the existing borders before the Middle East war of 1967.
In addition to the other issues discussed, the future State of Jerusalem is sacred for both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel requires a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of ten years from the signing of an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority only consents to a period of five years.
The shooters of the additional parasite control trial were closely watched by rangers, because the trial was controlled and its efficacy assessed.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) inc., qualified volunteers have been recruited, in the context of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, temporary conservation manager for the NPWS, the four shooters named for the first abattage campaign were properly trained and instructed in safety procedures.
Martelly has just appointed a provisional Electoral Council comprising nine members. 
It is the fifth GSP visit by Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the dissolution of the previous CEP in order to initiate a new electoral process.
This commission was the response of Martelly to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The violent protests sometimes that are triggered by the absence of elections, some of which were supposed to take place in 2011.
About 60 iPods have been reported overheating, resulting in six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been informed of 27 accidents involving these aircraft.
Last week, the METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which it had described as 'non-serious'.
The Ministry of Justice has reacted by calling it "really regrettable" that the report has been postponed by Apple.
The earthquake struck the Mariannes at 7:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday)
The Emergency Management Office of the Northern Mariana Islands has declared that no damage has been reported in this country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has stated that there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer abducted tourists from Hong Kong by diverting their bus to Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at tourists.
Many hostages have been rescued, and at least six of them have been confirmed dead so far.
- Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released prematurely, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took over the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the loo. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and has now become a doctor.
He went on to medical training and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When he was working at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature births during his free time. 
His research has shown that if a hormone is administered, it would accelerate the pulmonary maturation of the baby.
The Chinese news agency Xinhua reported that the government investigators recovered two flight recorders (black boxes) on Wednesday.
Others have also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of the extreme. My first manager. Luna died on two moons. A unique moment, like her. A strong woman.
Dustin'Goldust' Runnels commented that'Luna was as strange as me... or even more... I love her and she will be missed... I hope she rests in a better place.'
A survey conducted among 1,400 people before the federal elections in 2010 revealed that the number of opponents to the transformation of Australia into a republic had increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the federal election campaign that she thought Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 per cent of those polled share this view, and want the Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch to rule Australia.
At the extremes, 29 % of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 % believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was required to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his fitness was questioned.
He could not take the necessary medicines to overcome his pain, these being banned within the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer scientist at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the 25th January the largest number ever known.
Many people have checked the discovery using different software and hardware at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Cosmic comets may have been a source of water for the earth, as well as organic matter that can form proteins and promote life.
The scientists are hoping to understand how planets are formed, and in particular how the Earth was formed, because comets have collided with it for a long time.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor in January and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage in March.
He has called the rumours of 'political babblings and political nonsense'.
We think he will be the President in 2016.
According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that would allow aircraft to fly longer distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, reducing carbon emissions.
It is based on satellite technology, and not on ground-based radar systems used previously, which allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more detailed information.
The additional transport is non-existent and the surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and the parking and relay sites are not available on the ground.
The fear of not having enough transport has led to the possibility that the game could be played in a closed stadium, without the fans of the teams.
A study published on Thursday in the Science journal has reported the emergence of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have indicated that the new species had evolved in only two generations, although this process has been estimated to have taken much longer, due to the reproductive interbreeding between a Darwin's finch endemic, Geospiza fortis, and the finch immigrant with conical beak, Geospiza conirostris
You can shape gold in many ways. It can be rolled into tiny pieces.
It can be twisted and woven into thin threads, or it can be hammered or laminated into sheets.
It can be very fine, and glued to another metal. It can be so fine that it has sometimes been used to decorate hand-painted images in manuscripts called "enlumined manuscripts.
That is what we call the pH of a chemical. You can make a pH indicator by using red cabbage juice.
Le jus de chou changes de couleur according to the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the chemical tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electron (because hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron)." #
Mix the dry powders together, then, with clean hands and moist ones, press them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will produce an odd sensation and produce a shell-like effect.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets equipped with a flush in almost all the houses, connected to a sophisticated sewa
There were found remains of sewage systems in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman times, public baths sometimes included toilets where men and women could mingle.
When you call someone thousands of kilometres away, you use a satellite.
The satellite receives the call in space, then returns it to Earth almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts a part of our light and our vision.
A giant rocket of 30 meters or more in height is required to put a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in many ways. The greatest benefit it has brought us is to have made transport much simpler and faster.
It has brought us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Below are medium-sized carnivores that eat medium-sized prey, including rabbits, deer and other cattle.
In addition, there are many small cats (including free-roaming cats) that eat small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a special task for each feline, preventing it from competing with other.
The lions are the most sociable cats, living in large herds called prides.
Herds are composed of one to three adult males, as well as a thirty-some females and cubs.
Women are generally very close to each other, their families being composed of a large number of sisters and daughters.
The lions' troops act like wolves or dogs, animals that are remarkably similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in their behaviour, and also very deadly for their prey.
Balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (but sometimes difficultly), swim, jump great distances and pull with five times the strength of a powerful human.
The tiger is part of the same family (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones capable of roaring.
The roar of the tiger does not resemble the roar of the lion, but rather to a phrase whose words would be cries and groans.
The ocelot is a voracious carnivore. It will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if it can. Almost all the animals it hunts are much smaller than it.
According to scientists, ocelots hunt and find prey (prey) by smelling their journey on the ground.
They see very well at night thanks to their night vision, and they move very stealthily. The ocelots hunt their prey by blending into their environment before leaping on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population of which it is a part (for example, if it moves over a mountain range or river, or if it moves to a new island so that it can not easily return to it), it often finds itself in a different environment than it was previously.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so that the new population will need new characteristics or adaptations to be a powerful competitor against what it had previously needed.
The population of origin has not changed at all, it still needs the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look more and more like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they will no longer be regarded as belonging to the same species.
We call this process'speciation', which simply means the formation of new species. It is an inevitable and very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that we breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide that we exhale (that is, exhale).
Plants produce their food by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The mosasaur was the superpredator of the time, he did not fear anything, except other mosasaurs.
His long, sharp teeth were equipped with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, as well as a series of teeth in the mouth, so that anything that crossed his path could not escape.
We don't know for sure, but it may have been a tongue-twister.
He attacked everything that entered the water, even a giant dinosaur such as a T. rex was not up to the task against him.
While the Romans ate what we know today, they ate strange or unusual dishes, including snails, pigeons, cockroaches, and lobsters, a sort of rodent.
Another difference: while the poor and the woman ate their food sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to organise banquets where they rested on the side while they ate their meals.
The Roman meals of antiquity could not include these foods from America or Asia that were introduced in Europe centuries later.
For example, they did not have wheat, tomatoes, or potatoes, nor did any ancient Roman ever taste of lamb.
The Babylonians built temples for each of their gods, which were regarded as the dwellings of the god.
People brought offerings to the gods and priests tried to answer the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivities.
Each temple had a courtyard, then a inner sanctum to which only priests were permitted to enter.
Some pyramidal temples were sometimes built as part of a temple.
The summit of the tower was a special place for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle Ages, the house was not so important.
The bulk of the Jewish family life was outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were only open-air counters, giving onto the street. Houses were built of stone. 
As there were no great forests in Canaan, wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In Scandinavian sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder that he found Greenland and named it after him.
But regardless of its discovery, the Eskimo people lived there already in the past.
While each country is 'Nordic', there are many differences between the people, the kings, the customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the film Benjamin Gates and the Treasure of the Templars, you may think that a treasure map has been drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence. 
However, that is not true. Although there is a stamp on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, it read: 'Original Declaration of Independence dated 4 July 1776'. The text is on the reverse side of the document.
While nobody knows who wrote it, it is known that at an early stage of its existence, the great scroll (which measures approximately 29 inches three quarters on 24 inches) was rolled up. 
It is therefore likely that the rating was added simply as an indication.
The landing day and the subsequent battles freed the north of France, but the south was still not free.
She was ruled by French Vichy, French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupying power instead of facing it.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies landed in southern France, an invasion called Operation "Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French had liberated the south of France and were heading for Germany.
A civilisation is a culture shared by a significant number of people who live and work in cooperation, a society.
The word 'civilization' derives from the Latin word 'civis', which means civil and which is related to the Latin words 'civis', which means citizen, and 'civitas', which means city or state and which indicates also, in some way, the size of the society concerned. 
The cities-states are the pioneers of nations. A civilisational culture involves the transmission of knowledge on several generations, a durable cultural marking and an equitable distribution.
Minority cultures disappear often without leaving any historical traces and are not recognized as genuine civilizations.
In the revolutionary war, the thirteen States first formed a weak central government — the Congress being its only component — under the Articles of the Confederation.
The Congress did not have the power to impose taxes, and as there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on the authorities of the state, often less cooperative than it might have been.
He did not have the power to suspend tax laws or to those on customs duties between States.
The articles required unanimous consent of all States before they could be amended and States took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, with Germany's national team, the second most successful team in the world and they won the World Cup in 2006.
In popular sports there are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, equestrian sports, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1.
The winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, Italians participating in international and Olympic events.
Japan has more than 7 000 islands, which makes it the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of the group of islands that it comprises, Japan is often referred to, geographically speaking, as an 'archipelago'.
The first information about Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, while European sailors passing through it made mention of it as Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the south-west of Taiwan, introducing a transformation of traditional Chinese rice and sugar plantation practices, and employing Chinese workers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared them as part of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the first Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Treaty, by which it ceded Taiwan to Japan, which was then ruling the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the sun temple and the three-window room.
Many of the neighbouring buildings have been rebuilt to provide a better view of their original appearance.
In 1976, thirty per cent of the Machu Picchu had been restored and this restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format of photographic film is 35 mm; it was the most common format of film used at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still made today, but what is important is that its image format is inherited from the digital camera sensor format.
The 35 mm format is in fact, and it is quite surprising, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
So, we say that the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by 12 to get the simplest of integer ratios) is 3:2.
Many common formats (APS family, for example) are equal to this aspect or approach it closely.
The third-party rule, which has been abused and often made into a laughing-stock, is a simple directive which stimulates dynamism and offers protection.
He points out that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
In this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was being questioned.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has bound the European states together despite the differences in language and customs.
His omnipresence touched everyone, from the emperor to the peasants.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to relieve suffering and poverty and that the church's money is there specifically for this reason.
The central church authority was in Rome for more than 1000 years and this concentration of power and money has led many people to ask whether this doctrine was respected.
After the outbreak of hostilities, the United Kingdom set up a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategy has proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade has clearly violated international law generally accepted and codified by several international agreements of the past two centuries.
The UK mines international waters to prevent ships from venturing into entire areas of the sea, which represents a threat even to neutral ships.
As this tactic has elicited only a timid reaction, Germany expected a similar reaction in the face of its submarine warfare without limits.
In the 20th century, most citizens and nations showed a preference for pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, nations wished to avoid such a situation happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four hundred dollars in his name, a poem and a recommendation letter from Charles Batchelor (his previous employer) to Thomas Edison.
China's ancient history had a unique way of showing different eras; each era of China or each family in power was a distinct dynasty.
There were also periods of instability between dynasties. The most well-known of these periods is the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty.
In these periods, fierce battles have taken place between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms were one of the bloodiest periods in Chinese history. Thousands of people died in battle to sit on the throne of the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political repercussions such as the use of imperial measurements, the passing of absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people and not to one single leader.
Also, after the Revolution, the professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and the most talented to succeed.
It is the same for the army, because the classification of armies is no longer based on class, but on calibre.
The French Revolution has also inspired many other oppressed working-classes in other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions that transcended the worldly life. He would often visit a cave that became famous under the name of 'Hira' on the mountain of 'Noor' (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Set at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find, even if we know that it exists. When we entered the cave, we were completely isolated. 
Over there, you can only look up and see the clear sky and the many mountains surrounding it. From the inside of the cave, you can only see or hear very little of this universe.
The Great Pyramid of Gizeh is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third millennium BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many gigantic structures erected in honour of the Pharaohs who died.
The Giza Plateau, or 'Giza Necropolis', in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, many temples and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Kheops, and many small pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor his wives as well as his family.
The symbol 'push' looks like a V and the symbol 'pull' looks like a staple or a square with a missing bottom.
The top means you must begin by the tip and push the bow, and the bottom means you must begin by the arrow rest and pull the arrow.
A bow up produces a softer sound, while a bow down produces a louder sound.
Don't be afraid to write your own names in pencil, but don't forget that the printed archets are for a musical reason, and that you should therefore generally respect them.
On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old) and the sister of the king, Madame Elisabeth, all terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a
In a carriage they went back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and screamed threats against the king and the queen.
The King and Queen were forced to open the windows of their carriages because of the crowd.
At a point, a crowd member brandished the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles before the terrified queen.
The US imperialist war expenditures in the Philippines have been paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay colonial US taxes to cover a large part of the expenses and interest of the Philippine government bonds issued by Wall Street banks.
Of course, the superprofits derived from prolonged exploitation of the people of the Philippines could constitute the fundamental benefits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context in which they were created.
These events took place during the period generally considered to be the High Middle Ages - a period of European history from the eleventh to the thirteenth century (1000-1300).
The Middle Ages Central period was preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Low Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, including the technological push or the technological imperative, to a strict sense in which the destiny of humanity is determined by a logical underpinning linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies.
The majority of interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: technological development itself is a process that transcends cultural and political influences, and technology has an impact on societies that are intrinsically conditioned rather than socially.
For example, we could say that the car is a necessary condition for road development.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a few cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Massive car ownership also leads to an increased incidence of road accidents, which leads to the development of new techniques in the field of healthcare for treating personal injuries.
The Romanticism of the present day presents an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
According to Romantic theories, geography would have shaped the individuals and, over time, customs and a culture associated with this geography would have emerged. These, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris is known as the capital of the fashion of the contemporary world, Constantinople was seen as the capital of the medieval Europe.
His reputation as the centre of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until 1100 AD.
His status has declined over the twelfth century, mainly because the Crusaders returned with presents such as silk and spices, which the Byzantine markets could not compete with.
That is when the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its apogee between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At the beginning, the robe was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture, east.
But because of the slowness of communication, Western modes could be 25 to 30 years behind.
In the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of the time, following the crusades, was the use of buttons for closing clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is a form of agriculture practised to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
The subsistence farming system is a simple, often biological system using traditionally preserved seed from the region, combined with rotational farming or other simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers practised subsistence farming and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures are groups of people who feel neglected by the social norms and share the same ideas which enable them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnic origin, class, location and / or sex of members.
The criteria that determine a subculture as distinct from the mainstream can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
A subculture often signals its membership by distinctive and symbolic use of style, which encompasses fashion, manias and argot.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialisation is to draw on a few unfortunate cases of children who, by negligence, misfortune or wilful abuse, have not been socialised by adults during their childhood.
This includes children considered to be wild or ferocious. Some children were locked up by their own parents; in some cases, abandonment was due to a severe intellectual or physical disability suffered by the child.
Wild children may have suffered severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or escaping.
Others would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in the wild.
When they are raised entirely by non-human species, wild children display almost identical behaviours to those of the species that raised them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
As the project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the support goes further.
Support is not a method of learning but rather a means of helping learners who discover a new learning such as the use of a new programme or the beginning of a new project.
Supports can be both virtual and real. In other words, a professor is a form of support, but the little guy with the Microsoft Office trombone is also one.
Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are intended to guide, explain and explain procedures that could have been too difficult to manage for the student alone.
The children are taken away from their families for very diverse reasons which range from neglect to maltreatment, through extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, attentive and educational, but that is the case.
We perceive the family placement system as a safe zone for these children.
Our family placement system is supposed to provide safe, loving homes, stable education, and reliable health care.
The placement in foster care is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were previously removed.
Internet combines mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approaches to usages and gratifications.
For example, 'learning' and'socialization' are considered to be major factors favouring the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
'Personal involvement' and 'continuous relationships' have also been identified as being new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied the public reactions to the internet sites.
Video recording has led to great discoveries in the interpretation of facial expressions, which are the expressions of facial expression for a few milliseconds.
They claim that you can detect if someone is lying by interpreting correctly micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, has mentioned how people with brain damage are able to assess the sincerity with precision.
He suggests that such human-animal interpretation abilities may be found in domestic dogs.
The research of the twentieth century has shown that there are two genetic reservoirs: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and the selection removes it from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination alternate between the two basins at each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet his amino acid needs from available plant resources.
In addition, a lack of response has serious consequences: growth disturbances, malnutrition and ultimately, death.
The most easily accessible plant proteins would be those contained in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult to digest for us, unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest and provide a large amount of essential amino acids.
In all fairness, we should not be surprised if our own forefathers had solved their protein problem a little like chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentional waking during your sleep period and the subsequent unconsciousness (from 10 to 60 minutes).
It can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock, so that you can wake up without waking up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock while you are asleep, it may be placed on the other side of the room, making it necessary for you to get out of bed to turn it off.
The other possibilities based on the biorhythm include drinking a lot of liquids before going to bed (particularly water or tea, reputed to be diuretics), which forces you to wake up to go to the bathroom.
The degree of inner peace of a person opposes the degree of tension in his body and his mind.
Lower the tension, the more the present life force is positive. Each person has the opportunity to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way is our own tension and our negative emotions.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been enriched by the mahayana path and by many Indian techniques of yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (illumination energy) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The Tibetan center of meditation is the yoga of the deity. It is through visualizing different deities that the channels of energy are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the awareness of awakening is created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, deep conflicts between their different systems, methods and cultures ended the cooperation between these two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and see real combat, through proxy armies, on battlefields in Africa and Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defence was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
But these plans have become obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800 000 Soviet Red Army soldiers arrived and created the Bieloruss-Ukrainian front after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, as well as other international treaties, whether bilateral or multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods through the oceans.
The work of the armed forces has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and your property, while interfering with your enemy's ability to move his people and his property.
One of the most recent examples of this situation was the North Atlantic campaign during the Second World War. The Americans were trying to cross the Atlantic Ocean to send troops and equipment to help Great Britain.
At the same time, German naval forces, using mainly U-boats, tried to stop this trade.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as she did for the rest of Europe.
It seems that sheep have been domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribal groups began to keep them close to them to have easy access to milk, hair, meat and skin.
Domestic cattle were usually kept in herds that wandered on the hills or other pastures, often cared for by shepherds who were usually children or adolescents, similar to the more familiar term of shepherds.
The 'wagonways' were built in England in the sixteenth century.
While the railway tracks were simply made of parallel planks of wood, they allowed horses to reach greater speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the slightly more accident-prone roads of the day.
The cross-ties were introduced early to keep the tracks in place. However, it has become apparent that the tracks would be more effective if they were provided with a steel plate on top.
It has become a common practice, but the iron has caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails were introduced.
The first means of locomotion was walking: humans began walking upright about two million years ago with the arrival of the Homo Erectus ("right-handed man").
 Their predecessors, the australopithecines, did not stand up like usual.
There are bipedal specializations in fossils of Australopithecus from 4,2 to 3,9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs already seven million years ago.
We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even campaign to reduce the sufferings to come.
In many cases, it is a symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not just want a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problem and turn it off.
It is clear that the world has changed thanks to scientific and technological developments made by human beings, and that the problems have become more important because of the overpopulation and extravagant way of life of mankind.
After it was adopted by Congress on July 4, a manuscript signed by the Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
At night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap Broadsides.
The first reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the Independence Hall courtyard on 8 July.
One of them was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who read it to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy reached London on 10 August.
The 25 sheets Dunlap that are still known to exist are the oldest copies of the document. The original manuscript copy has not survived.
Many palaeontologists now believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive. They are called birds.
Many people regard them as dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly.
But there are still a lot of things about birds that look like a dinosaur.
They have scales on their feet and claws, they lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in binary.
A binary number can only have one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary numbers, or bits for using the computer jargon.
An internal poisoning may not be visible immediately. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are sufficiently general to allow a diagnosis to be made without delay.
The best indicator of internal poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of toxic household chemicals or medicines.

The term 'insect' is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term 'parasite' derives from an old familiarity with bed bugs, which are very adapted to parasitizing humans.
The snails, like bed bugs, are nidicolous, that is to say adapted to live in the nest or habitat of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400 000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which makes it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, consisting of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis than men.
A couple can very well feel that it is not in their interest, nor in the child's interest, to look after the child's education.
These couples can choose to adopt their baby.
in the context of adoption, the biological parents end their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main objective of science is to understand how the world works by means of scientific method. This method guides in fact most scientific research.
It is not the only, experimentation, and an experiment is a test that serves to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, pose questions and observe, but it also orients the scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers have concentrated on ancient texts, and in particular on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's opinions on all scientific matters, including psychology, have been accepted.
With the decline of knowledge of Greek, the West has been cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behaviour depend on the presence of internal clocks and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which do not simply represent responses to periodic stimuli external to living beings, have been documented for most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to operate in a certain period even without external stimulation.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacteria.
They have carried out two experiments to mark the phage DNA with a radioactive phosphorus, or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the extent of the mutated material, and whether the mutated cells are germ cells.
Only germ cell mutations can be passed on to children, while other mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism is aimed at people who want to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, including wildlife and flora.
Hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying the information on the ecosystem are examples of activities on the spot.
You can go and see, photograph and discover the orang-utans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small towns in the countryside by car to get to their places of work and cross other people who are going to work in the country they just left.
In this dynamic bus service, each is connected to a private car-based transport system and supports it.
The science now shows that this massively carbon-based economy has driven the biosphere out of its stable state that has supported human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about water quality or bridge collapses.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they break down so frequently? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flows are the study of the movements of drivers and private vehicles between two points, and the interactions they exert between themselves.
It is difficult to study traffic flow because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act within a reasonable range; so, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically in an approximate way.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) the flow, (2) the density and (3) the speed.
These relationships help to plan, design and operate road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly enabled them to escape more easily from their enemies and to find more effectively food and companions.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body.
It gives them more places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and the transient.
There are some 6,000 years ago, a man called Aristarchus said that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed he was wrong: that the solar system was moving around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
It seems sensible, because the Earth does not seem to be moving, is it not?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times the volume of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the largest river in the world, reaching up to 10 km wide.
At least 20 % of the water that flows from rivers in the world into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River channel is 6 387 km (3 980 miles). It collects water from thousands of small rivers.
While the construction of pyramids continued up to the end of the Ancient Empire, the Great Pyramid of Gizeh never surpassed its size and the quality of its construction.
Ancient Egyptians were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, who had then been in existence for more than a thousand years.
Vatican City has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and the least populated.
The Vatican City drafts its legislation and official communications in Italian.
The Italian is also the language of everyday use by most of the people working in the state, while the Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
The citizens of the Vatican City are all Catholics.
From antiquity, people have been familiar with the basic elements of the chemical world, such as gold, silver and copper, because they are found in nature in the form of raw materials and are relatively simple to mine using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, has theorised that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. It was earth, water, air and fire.
It was rather the four states of matter (in the same order) : solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although he also made the assertion that these states change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered as metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys which contain a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of minuscule particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that billions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it was first introduced.
Regrettably, the emergence of new wording has relegated the pen to a more confidential status and to a more rare use.
People are now writing their messages on screens, without ever having to touch a pencil.
It is hard to imagine what the keyboard will become when the next new thing comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it transforms energy into assembling a nucleus of a myriad of protons and neutrons.
Like if you were to make a hill climb by a heavy cart. Dividing the core again, then letting some of that energy out.
Some atoms have a highly unstable nucleus, so that they tend to break up with little or no pressure.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust. Its outer layer is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the visible side and 100 km on the hidden side.
It is finer at sea level and thicker under continents.
There may be more maria on the side near because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are concerned with the search for what makes people feel good or attracted.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they matured into adulthood.
These theories examine what drives some people to want what they do and what drives them to do or not do certain things in their environment.
Popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviours can emerge when a manager becomes the boss of former colleagues. At one end of the spectrum being to try to stay ‘the good friend’ (or the good friend).
This type of manager is not very good at taking unpopular decisions, leading disciplinary actions, carrying out appraisals, and holding others accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes a person who is unrecognizable, who feels that he or she must change everything that the group has created up to now and do things in his or her own way.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behaviour often leads to friction between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual members of a team work often as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet at different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
A real "invisible" team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also an unique element of a virtual team.
The "invisible" team is the management team to which each member reports. It establishes standards for each of them.
Why would an organisation want to create a structure for learning? One of the objectives of learning organisational concepts is innovation.
When all the available resources are used effectively in the functional services of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can be expressed fully.
Thus, a process of working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new process of innovation to meet the needs of the customer.
Before an organisation can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and a culture of learning.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organisations achieve better results.
Neurobiological data provide material evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research. They allow us to reduce the research field and make it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, lesions, tumours and brain trauma affect behaviour and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies has enabled us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
It gives us a lot of information and material to build models of simulation that help us understand the processes in our heads.
Although artificial intelligence is often strongly associated with science fiction, it is an important part of the computer science field that studies the behaviour, learning and adapting intelligently of a machine.
Artificial intelligence research is aimed at automating tasks requiring an intelligent approach.
These include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnostics and customer questions, as well as recognition of writing, voice and face.
These practices have led to distinct disciplines, focused on providing solutions to the everyday problems of people's lives.
The artificial intelligence system is now being used in a number of fields, such as economics, medicine, engineering and military, as it was used in many home computer software and video games.
Excursions are integral to any school. Often, a teacher would like to take his students to places where a bus journey is not possible.
The solution is provided by technology in the form of virtual educational excursions. Students can watch the ancient artifacts of a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a beautiful work of art while sitting in their class.
Participating in an excursion is also a good way to think about a trip and to share your experiences with future generations.
For example, students at Bennett High School in North Carolina design and maintain a website each year about their visit to the capital of the state. Each year, the site is updated, but the old versions are kept online for use as an album.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Even if students often try blogging with poor grammar and spelling, the fact that they have a public makes it more likely that the situation will improve.
As students are often the most critical, the author of the blog begins to try to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging forces students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
When used properly, blogs can help students to strengthen their analytical and critical thinking skills: by responding actively to online content, they can confront their own opinions with those of others and expose their own points of view on specific topics.
Ottawa is the charming capital bilingual of Canada and has a large number of galleries of art and museums which highlight the past and present of Canada.
You will find more south the falls of Niagara and north, the Muskoka region and its environs which have a virgin natural beauty.
All these measures, and many more, make Ontario what foreigners regard as the quintessential of Canada.
A large part of the northernmost regions are sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited at the wild state.
For a comparison of the population that surprises more than one: There are more African-Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The Eastern African islands are located in the Indian Ocean, close to the African coast.
Madagascar is by far the biggest country, and even a continent on its own, in terms of wildlife.
Most of the small islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known for being luxury beach resorts.
Arabs also brought the practice of Islam to the land and this religion has spread widely to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European and colonial influence began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route linking Europe to India.
North, the region is defined by the Sahel, and to the south and east by the Atlantic Ocean.
To women: It is recommended that all women who travel say that they are married, irrespective of their civil status.
It is also advised to wear a wedding ring (which should not seem too precious.)
Women must realise that some cultural differences may result in behaviours that they regard as harassment. Indeed, it is common for women to be followed, caught by the arm, etc.
Be firm in your refusal of advances, and be not afraid to hold your ground (cultural or otherwise, that does not mean that it is acceptable!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the tenth century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Merovingians as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese, who after destroying it had rebuilt it and named it Casa Branca, finally abandoned it in 1755 after a quake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name of Daru l-Badya, and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in all of Morocco for shopping.
Around the old medina, you can easily find places where to buy traditional Moroccan products, such as tajines, pottery, leather goods, and all kinds of handicrafts, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located in the extreme east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano which buried most of the city's streets, in particular the city centre.
While Goma is reasonably safe, all visits to the outside of Goma should be subject to searches to understand the state of the fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of Nyiragongo volcano and for gorilla tracking treks among the least expensive in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motor taxi) to get around in Goma. The normal fare (local) is about 500 CFA for a short trip.
Combined with its relative remoteness, 'Tombouctou' has become a metaphor for distant and exotic countries.
Today, Tombouctou is a poor city, though its reputation as a tourist attraction has made it a popular destination.
In 1990, it was added to the World Heritage List as a threatened site because of the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stages of the PBS program " Wonders of the African World ".
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country, because it has a more Arab style than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and runs along the Mozambique border to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the border south is the Crocodile River.
The total surface area of the park is 19 500 km2, divided into 14 ecosystems, each of which contains a specific fauna.
This is one of the most famous South African National Parks and regarded as the jewel in the crown of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As for all South African national parks, there are daily entry and conservation fees.
It may be advantageous to obtain a Wild Card which gives access to certain South African national parks, as well as all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the name given to the territory of Hong Kong and represents the main centre of interest for many tourists.
The row of buildings that forms the horizon of Hong Kong was compared to a shimmering bar chart, which is revealed by reflection in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To admire the most beautiful panoramas of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to Kowloon's front line located in front.
The vast majority of the island's urban development is concentrated on the north bank of the harbour.
This is the place that the British colonists have invested. Thus, it seems to be a reasonable starting point, if you are looking for evidence of colonial past in this region.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest mangrove swamp belt, extending for 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the backwaters of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forest area located on the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not only composed of mangrove swamps: they also contain some of the last vestiges of the majestic jungles that covered the Ganges plain long ago.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3 850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water/wetlands.
Sundarbans is a nature reserve since 1966, you will find approximately 400 Bengal tigers and 30 000 spotted deer.
Buses leave the district bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, but most, especially those that serve the east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6 and 7 a. m.
Inter-district buses are often full, so it is advisable to buy a ticket in advance.
Most districts are served by Japanese coasters, which are comfortable and robust.
The shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to get to places close by, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock Bridge is a suspension bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to link the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in Guyana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 metres; they are 378 metres long and have two 3m wide lanes.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. The structure was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge should be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs posts will be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group living in what is now the eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also practising subsistence farming.
Other indigenous tribes that populated the Chaco, such as the Guaycurú or the Payaguá, survived primarily by fishing, hunting, or gathering.
In the sixteenth century, Paraguay was called the 'giant province of the Indies', the result of the encounter between the Spanish conquistadors and the indigenous peoples.
The Spanish colonised the period of colonisation, which lasted three centuries.
From the foundation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain a large part of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best teams and among the best players in polo in the world.
The biggest polo tournament of the year takes place in December at Las Cañitas polo fields.
In addition, smaller tournaments and matches are sometimes organised here at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, please visit the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands Pound (FKP) which is equivalent to a pound sterling (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the sole Stanley Island bank, located opposite the FIC West shop.
The pound sterling is a widely accepted currency in the islands, while in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the nearby islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, even if it is possible that British and American dollars will be accepted. Talk to the owners in advance about a payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange money from the Falklands Islands outside of the islands, so change it before you leave the islands.
Montevideo is located in the southern hemisphere, and winter in the northern hemisphere corresponds to summer there.
Montreal is located in a subtropical zone and summer temperatures exceeding 30 °C are common.
Winter can be misleadingly cold: temperatures rarely fall below zero, but wind and humidity combine to give the impression that it is colder than what the thermometer says.
There is no real season of 'wet' and 'dry': the rainfall is pretty constant all year round.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, they are wild animals; please do not feed them or disturb them.
According to the park authorities, you must be at least 100 metres away from bears and wolves and at least 25 metres away from all other wild animals!
As placid as they may appear, the bison, the elk, the caribou, the wolf and almost all the great animals can attack.
Each year, tens of visitors are injured because they did not keep a sufficient distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them some space.
In addition, know that odours attract wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking odours and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of about 40 000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and is the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a naval tragedy in 1889 when seven German, American and British ships refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans were killed.
The Supreme Head of State Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was murdered during a peaceful rally held in the city during the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement.
The beaches are numerous, because Auckland is at the junction of two ports. The most popular are in three zones.
The beaches of North Shore (in the district of North Harbour) lie on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay to Devonport to the south.
Most beaches are sandy and allow safe swimming, and most are shaded by Pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are on the Waitemata Harbour, in the affluent suburb of Mission Bay and in Saint Heliers in the centre of Auckland.
The beaches, sometimes very frequented by families, have many shops along the coast. Swimming is safe there.
The main local beer is 'Number One', a rather ordinary beer, but tasty and refreshing. There is also another local beer, the 'Manta'.
There are many French wines to taste, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may travel better.
You can drink tap water without any danger, but you can easily find bottled water if you have any concerns about it.
For Australians, the idea of a 'coffee cream' is foreign. A black short is an 'espresso', a cappuccino is filled with cream (not foam) and the tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is Belgian standard. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many voyages on the coral reef are made throughout the year, and injuries caused by one of these causes on the coral reef are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the advice of authorities, obey all signs and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
From October to April, north of 1770, the box jellyfish arrive near the beaches and estuaries of rivers. They can also sometimes be seen outside this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most of them are afraid of humans and would run away.
Salmon crocodiles do not live in active salt water, their main habitat is in estuary rivers in north Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travellers the peace of mind that they will have somewhere to sleep once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but you can also book through travel agencies of other types of accommodation, such as camping sites.
Travel agencies usually offer packages including breakfast, airport transfers or even packages combining flights and accommodation.
They can also hold your booking if you need time to think about the offer or to procure other documents necessary for your destination (for example, a visa).
Any change or request must, however, be submitted to the travel agency first and not directly to the hotel.
In some music festivals, most participants decide to stay overnight, and most consider that this is an integral part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the music event, you have to arrive early to find a good camping site.
Don't forget that even if the music shows are over on the main stages, other music shows can continue until late at night on other sites of the festival.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the Baltic in winter, be sure to check the location of the hut, because the crossing of the ice can cause unbearable noises at the most exposed huts.
Cruises to St Petersburg include time spent in the city. Passengers on cruise ships are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos generally make a lot of efforts to maximise the time and money spent by customers. There are very few windows and clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer special offers of food, drinks and entertainment to keep the guests happy and to keep them there.
On some sites, it is the locals who offer free alcoholic beverages. However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good players should know that it is crucial to remain sober.
Anyone who drives to high latitudes or crosses mountains must consider the possibility of snow, ice or cold temperatures.
On the icy roads and icy conditions, the friction is low and you cannot drive like you are on the asphalt.
In the blizzards, it can fall in very little time enough snow to block you.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall or snowdrifts, or by condensation or frost on the windows of vehicles.
In addition, the presence of ice and snow is normal in many countries, and motoring is practically uninterrupted all year round.
Safaris are perhaps the most popular tourist attraction in Africa and the most memorable moment for many visitors.
In everyday parlance, the term ‘safari’ refers to an African excursion, and in particular to a safari in the African savannah, with the aim of witnessing the amazing spectacle of wild animals in their natural habitat.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach close to cars and the standard equipment allows them to be observed.
Lion, cheetah and leopards are sometimes timid and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called 'walking in the bush', 'walking safari' or 'footing') consists of walking, either for a few hours, or for several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will take place in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympic Games, after hosting the Games in 1964.
If you have booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you could find yourself in a tricky situation.
The policies of cancellation vary, but from mid-March most of the cancellation policies based on the coronavirus do not extend to July 2020, the date on which the Olympic Games had been scheduled.
We expect that most events tickets will cost between 2 500 and 130 000 yens, typical event tickets costing approximately 7 000 yens.
While ironing wet clothes, you can make them dry faster. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards that can be borrowed, even if there are no irons in the rooms.
If you do not have a hair dryer or do not want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if you find one.
Avoid leaving the fabric too hot (which can cause its shrinkage or in the most extreme cases, burn it).
There are different methods of water purification, including some that are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, you just boil the water for a minute, but in others, you have to boil it for several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you have a problem, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers can encounter pests they do not know in their home region.
Parasites may contaminate food, cause irritations or, in the most serious cases, cause allergic reactions, spread venom or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, are not usually considered as parasites.
In some areas, duty free shops present an opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and customs duties.
Travellers to countries where the duty is high can sometimes save a great deal of money, particularly on alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The Buffalo-Pittsburgh section of the interstate highway passes through isolated areas of the backcountry.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep an open mind: the steep slopes, narrow roads and tight curves predominate.
Speed limits displayed are considerably lower than in previous sections and following – usually at 35 to 40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and strict compliance is still more important than previously.
By contrast, mobile service is surprisingly much stronger here than on many other parts of the road, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cakes are rather good, and in Bavaria, they are very rich and varied, like those of their southern neighbour, Austria.
Fruit cakes are a common feature of Hungarian pastry: apples are baked and baked in pastry all year round, while pears and plums are in season in summer.
Many German bakery products also contain hazelnuts, almonds and other nuts. Popular cakes often go well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want small but tasty Berliners, try the Berliners, also called Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the regions.
A curry is a dish made up of herbs and spices, accompanied by meat or vegetables.
A curry dish can be solid or liquid, depending on the amount of sauce it contains.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in the south of India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesia having 17 000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a generic term covering a wide variety of regional cuisines present in all of the country.

The stirrups are the supports for the feet of the rider, which hang from each side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability to the user, but they can pose a safety problem: for example, the user's feet may be trapped.
If a rider is thrown from a horse, but has a leg caught in the stirrup, he could be dragged if the horse escapes. To minimize this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
Firstly, most horses wear riding boots with a flat sole and a smooth leather upper.
Then, some saddles, such as English saddles, have safety bars which allow a rider to fall off the saddle if the rider is pulled back by a rider who falls.

It resembles alpine skiing, as well as mountaineering, but does not include these activities, which are usually carried out on rocky terrain and require the use of much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of skiing as a similar hiking route.
In good conditions, you can walk a little further than you can on foot – but you will rarely reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy pack on a muddy track.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but containing many independent countries. In normal circumstances, travelling through several countries involves several visa applications and several passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, works a little bit like one country in this respect.
As long as you remain within this area, you can usually cross borders without having to go through passport control points.
In addition, having a Schengen visa you do not need to apply separately for each of the Schengen states, which allows you to save time, money and administrative procedures.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique. Some tax authorities define items over 100 years old as antiquities.
The criteria vary according to the place where one is located; in some parts of the world, such as North America, the age limit may be lower than that in force in Europe.
Artisanal products can be regarded as antiquities even if they are less ancient than similar industrial products.
Riding reindeer is a major means of subsistence for the Samis and the culture surrounding this trade is of great importance to many other professions.
Although, according to tradition, all Samis have not been involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry, they lived off fishing, hunting and other similar activities, and used reindeer mainly as livestock.
Today, many Samis practice modern occupations. Tourism is an important source of income in Lapland, the Sami region.

Anyone considering going to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive appropriate professional training.
A search on the Internet for 'hazardous environment courses' will probably lead to an address of a local company.
A course will cover this subject in much greater detail, usually with a practical experience.
A training usually lasts for two to five days and includes role playing, first aid, and sometimes shooting practice.
The books and magazines on survival in the wild are commonplace, but the publications on war zones are scarce.
Travellers planning to undergo a gender reassignment abroad should ensure that they have valid travel documents for their return journey.

Shore breakers are the waves that return from breaking waves, often on a reef or equivalent.
Because of the underwater topography, the return flow is concentrated on a few deeper sections, and a fast current can form in the deeper waters.
These deaths are caused by exhaustion which results from trying to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
When you leave the current, it is not more difficult to swim back than it is usually.

The northern part, or Sentinel Range, contains the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which stands at 4892 m.
In remote areas, without cellular network, you may not have other choice than to use satellite telephony.
A satellite telephone does not replace a mobile telephone, because you need to be outside and have a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
It is a service often used by navigation, including recreational craft, and by expeditions that have data transmission and telephony needs.
Your local telephone operator should be able to tell you more about the connection to this service.
The ones who plan a year off have the possibility to learn while traveling, and more and more of them choose this option.
This is particularly popular with young people who leave school, because it allows them to take a year off before university, without compromising their studies.

While the archipelago coasts and the largest lakes are certainly big enough for a yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Sailing is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden and New Zealand are in the same situation, but apart from that, it is a unique case (in the Netherlands, for example, the number is one to forty).

Transport companies are well paid to deliver goods quickly. Often, in an urgent repair, the question of time is crucial for documents, goods or spare parts that relate to them.
On some roads, the big companies have their own planes, but on other roads and for the small companies, there was a problem.
If they had shipped goods by air, on some routes, it would have taken days to clear customs and to get the goods to the port.
The only way to get it to them was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations will not allow them to send a bag without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The easiest way to travel in first class or business class is to pay a large sum of money for this privilege (or, better still, ask your company to do it for you).
However, it is not cheap: generally you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare, and eleven times for first class!
Generally, it is pointless to try to obtain discounts for business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that they can count on a certain type of passenger who are prepared to pay very high prices for the privileges of speed and comfort, and they set their prices knowingly.
The capital of the Republic of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is very common.
