Yesterday, the new temporary electoral council (TEC) was sworn in by nine members.
This is the fifth CEP Marchetti in four years.
In the past month the presidential commission recommended the previous Temporary Elections Council to resign as part of the package of measures for moving the country towards new elections.
The Commission was a response to the mass protests against the state regime that began in October.
These sometimes accompanied by violence protests were caused by the failure to hold elections, some of which were due to be held in 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating of faulty iPods have been reported, resulting in six fires and four minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) stated that it had been informed of 27 cases involving these devices.
Last week the Ministry of Economics, Labour and Industry announced that Apple informed it of 34 additional cases of overheating that Apple called "minor.
The ministry said the delay was "very disappointing.

Of the 1400 people surveyed ahead of the federal elections in 2010, 8 percent of those who are against the idea of Australia becoming a republic, have risen from 2008 to 2010.
The acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard during the federal election campaign in 2010 expressed her opinion that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34% of respondents share this view and want Elizabeth II to become the last monarch of Australia.
The poll showed that 29 percent of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent think it does not need a republic.
Olympic gold medallist Milorad Cavic was supposed to participate in the 100 and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but because of his complaints his physical condition is now under scrutiny.
He could not take the painkillers because they are banned in the Games.
Kirt Kupper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the Central Missouri University, 25 January opened the largest known simple number.
On Tuesday, it was announced that a few people confirmed this discovery through various hardware and software.
Maybe comets were the source of water delivery to Earth, as well as the source of organic matter that could form proteins and support life.
We hope to understand how planets formed, especially how Earth formed, because comets collided with Earth very long ago.
53-year-old Kumonosu Ichiro became governor of the prefecture in early this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage in the past month.

It is expected that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, will allow planes to fly on reduced routes and save millions of gallons of fuel, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
The aircraft uses satellite technology instead of the old ground-based radar technology, which will allow air traffic controllers to more accurately determine the position of aircraft and give pilots more accurate information.
There is no additional transport to Wembley, there will be no stops on the underground, and there are no parking and pick-up points.
The fears of not having transport caused the speculation that the Games might have to be held behind closed doors without fans.
In the description of the study published in Thursday's Science, it is said that a new species of birds has been discovered on the Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University (USA) and Uppsala University (Sweden) have reported that due to the mating of the endemic finch Geospiza darwinii with the introduced finch Geospiza conirostris, a new species has evolved in just two
Gold can be cut into any shape. It can be rolled into very small shapes.
It can be twisted into a thin wire, which can be twisted and woven. It can be made of gold or silver wire.
It can be made very thin and attached to another metal. It can be made so thin that sometimes it was used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books - the so-called "frontispiece".
This is called pH of a chemical substance. You can make a pH indicator by using red cabbage juice.
Tomato juice changes colour depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical substance.
The pH-value is determined by the concentration of ions of hydrogen (H) in the chemical substance being studied.
The hydrogen ions are protons that have been separated from their electrons (hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron
Get a new mixture by mixing two dry powders in one container, then wet your hands and form a ball of this mixture.
The water on your hands will react with the top layer, which will be unusual, then form a kind of shell.
In almost every town of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro there was a toilet with a flush, connected to a complex sewer
The remains of the drainage systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
The toilets were also in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets sometimes were part of public baths, where men and women were washed together
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives a call and almost instantly reflects it back down.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the atmosphere of Earth distorts our light and view.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, you need a giant rocket that is over 100 feet tall.
The wheel has changed the world in an unbelievable way. The wheel has given us a much easier and faster transportation.
It gave us a train, a car and many other means of transport.
Under them are more cats of medium size, which eat small game from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, many small cats (including roaming domestic cats) eat and hunt on much larger animals, such as insects, rodents, snakes and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a special work that each cat does, which keeps it from competing with other cats.
The lions are the most social cats, living in large groups, which are called prides.
In the herd there are up to three adult males, in close relationship, and up to thirty youngsters. 
The females usually live together in the same family and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
The lion prides behave very much like packs of wolves or dogs - animals that are so similar to lions (but not other large cats) and are also very dangerous for their victims.
Being athletically developed, the tiger can climb trees (though not very well), swim, jump over long distances and pull with five strong men.
Tiger belongs to the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones who possess the ability to roar.
The tiger’s growl is not like the roar of a lion, but more like a babbling of unintelligible words.
Orcas are fond of eating small animals. If an opportunity presents itself, they will catch monkeys, snakes, lizards, and birds. Almost all animals, on which the orca hunts, are much smaller than him.
Scientists believe that the otters follow the tracks of animals and find their prey by smell, tracking its movements on the ground.
They are able to see in the dark with night vision and almost undetectable movement. Predators track prey, blending into the surroundings, and then attacking the prey.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) separates from the main population from which they originated (for example, if they cross a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment than they were previously in.
This new ecosystem has other resources and other competitors, so the new population will need other characteristics or changes compared to those it had before, to become a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed much — it still needs the same adaptations as it did before.
Over time, as the new population adapts to the new environment, it will become less and less like the rest of the population.
Over time, these two populations will look so different that it will be impossible to say that they are the same species.
We call this process the formation of species, that is, the emergence of new species. The formation of species is an essential consequence and a very significant part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which the human breathes, and absorb carbon dioxide, which the human exhales.
Plants feed from the sun by photosynthesis. In addition, they cast shade.
We build our houses and make clothes out of plants. The vast majority of our food is plants. Without plants, animals would not have survived.
The mosaic was the most fearsome predator of its time, so it did not fear anyone but other mosaics.
His long jaws were full of more than 70 sharp teeth, and there was a second row of teeth on the tongue, so that those who met him were not saved.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that his language was split in two. He ate crocodiles, large fish, other Mosasaurs, and he could
He also attacked all that entered the water; even the giant dinosaur, such as the Tyrannosaurus, was not able to compare with him.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their own strange and unusual dishes that they served during banquets. For example, a deer, a peacock, a frog and a rodent like a mole.
There was another difference: while the poor people and women ate sitting on chairs, the rich people liked to organize joint feasts, during which they ate lying on the side.
The Roman diet could not include foods that were brought to Europe from America or Asia in the following centuries.
In particular, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Romans had tried beef.
Babylonians built each god a main temple, considered to be the dwelling of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to please the gods on the ceremonies and festivals.
Each church had an open churchyard and a sanctuary inside which priests could enter only.
Occasionally, as elements of a temple, they built special towers in the form of pyramids.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, a house was not of much importance.
The majority of the Jewish family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were open shelves, which were facing the street. For the construction of houses, the stone was used.
On the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
Grenada was sparsely populated. In the Scandinavian sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was expelled from Iceland for killing and that he moved further west and discovered Greenland and gave it
But regardless of its opening, there were already indigenous tribes living there.
Although each of the countries was Nordic, there were many differences between the people, rulers, traditions and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie "Treasure of the Nation", you may think that the reverse side of the Declaration of Independence depicted a map of treasure.
But that is not true. Although something is written on the reverse of the document, that is not a map of the treasure.
The declaration’s back side reads: "The Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4, 1776." The text is written in the bottom and upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence this large parchment document (size 293⁄4 x 241⁄2 inches) was folded for smart storage
In other words, it's entirely possible that the note was added just as a note.
The operation "Neptune" and subsequent battles freed the northern part of France, but the southern part of France was still not freed.
He was under the control of the Vichy French. These Frenchmen, signed a peace treaty with the Germans in 1940, and worked together with the occupiers instead of fighting them.
The invasion of France in 1940 was called "Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Free French Forces and the Americans liberated southern France and headed for Germany.
Civilization is a culture that is shared by a large number of people, living and working together, society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin "civis" meaning "citizen" and is related to the Latin words civis, meaning "citizen", and civitas, meaning "city" or "city-state", and it
Cities-states are the precursors of nations. Civilizational culture involves the transmission of knowledge through several generations, continuous cultural presence and transferable cultural legacy.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving any historical evidence and therefore cannot be recognized as authentic civilizations.
In the War of Independence, the USA, in accordance with Articles of the Confederation, for the first time formed a weak central government, the sole organ of which was the Congress.
The Congress had no authority to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial branch, it relied on the powers of the states, which often refused to cooperate and did not enforce all its acts.
He had no authority to annul the tax legislation and the tariffs of the states.
To amend the Constitution requires unanimous approval of all the states, but the states have so disrespected the central government that their representatives seldom appeared.
The Italian national football team, along with Germany, is the second most successful team in the world and in 2006 won the World Cup.
The most popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, roller hockey, ice hockey, roller derby and Formula One
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions. Residents of Italy from these regions participate in international competitions and Olympics.
In Japan there are 7000 islands (the largest of which is Hokkaido), which makes Japan the seventh largest island in the world!
Japan is often referred to as an archipelago with geographical point of view.
The island of Taiwan was named Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island" by European sailors who passed by in the 15th century.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base on the southwest of Taiwan, initiating the transformation of native methods of grain production and hiring Chinese workers to work on their rice and sugar
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Empire of China.
In 1895, after the defeat in the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Sino-Japanese Convention, which ceded Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until
Machu Picchu is made up of three main structures, namely the Inca Temple of the Sun, the Temple of the Three Windows, and the Inca Walls.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex were rebuilt to give tourists a more precise idea of how they looked originally.
In 1976, only 30% of Machu Picchu was restored. Restoration works continue to this day.
For example, the most common format for static photographs is 35 mm, and this was the dominant size of film on the market in the analogue era.
It is still made, but more important is the fact that the aspect ratio of the images of digital cameras inherited the sizes of the images.
The 35mm format is a little confusing, it has a width of 36 mm and a height of 24 mm.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided into two parts to get a ratio with small whole numbers) is therefore called 3:2.
Many common formats (like the APS family of formats) are close or even approach these proportions.
Too often used and often mocked by the rule of thirds is a simple recommendation that creates dynamism, while maintaining a certain degree of order in the image
It says that the best place to place the main object is on the intersection of lines that divide the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example
In the course of this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which became rich and powerful, was the object of close attention.
On more than a thousand years of Christianity, it united European countries despite the differences in languages and traditions.
Her omnipresent power touched everyone - from the king to the common man.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to ease suffering and poverty, and that the money of the church exists to facilitate this purpose.
The center of the church's authority was based in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth led to many doubting whether this dogma was being observed.
In the immediate aftermath of the war, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
This strategy has proven itself to be effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated all of the international laws that have been in place for two centuries.
Britain has detonated international waters to prevent warships from entering entire sectors of the oceans, putting at risk even neutral ships.
Because the response to this tactic was muted, Germany expected such a response to its unhindered submarine operations.
In the 1920s, among the majority of citizens and nations, there were such sentiments as pacifism and isolation.
By learning about the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the countries wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America, and accepted the offer to work in the company Edison in the city of New York.
He came to America with four pennies in his pocket, a book of poetry and a recommendation from Charles Batchelor, who was his boss at the previous job, to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, the use of unique methods of time-stamping allowed each stage of China or each family to be a special dynasty.
In addition, between the reigns of each dynasty there was disorder and instability. The most famous period of the Three Kingdoms was 60 years during the reigns of the Han and Qin
In this period, there were many bloody battles between many noblemen vying for the throne.
The period of Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting for the throne in the great court in the city of Xian
There are many such social and political effects, such as the use of a metre system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not
Also after the Revolution, opportunities for work opened up to all men, which allowed the most ambitious and talented to achieve success.
And this also applies to the army, because the ranks have been based on qualities, not on the origin of the individual.
The French Revolution also inspired many other workers to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in topics that did not concern the worldly life. He often visited the cave known as Hira on the mountain "Nûr" (light) for reflection.
And the cave which is preserved until this day, very vividly gives us an idea of the spiritual aspirations of Muhammad.
The cave is located on the top of a mountain to the north of Mecca and completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It is very difficult to detect even to those who know about it. In the cave, the person is isolated from the outside world.
There is nothing but pure beautiful sky above your head and many surrounding mountains. From the depths of the cave you can see and hear only a very small part of this world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that is still standing today.
The Great Pyramid of Giza was built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE and is one of the many great pyramids built to honor the memory of the Pharaoh.
The Great Pyramid of Giza, or the Valley of the Kings, in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, includes several pyramids (including the Great Pyramid of Giza), several small tombs, several temples and the Great Sphinx.
Great Pyramid was built in honour of the Pharaoh, and many smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honour of the wives of the Pharaoh and his relatives.
The cello bow movement sign looks like a V, and the bow movement sign down looks like a square or a circle without a bottom.
Up" means you should start at the tip of the bow and move the bow forward, and "down" means you should start at the place where your hand holds the bow and move it back.
The upstroke is usually softer, while the downstroke is more forceful.
You can draw your own brushstrokes, but remember that the brushstrokes are printed for musical reasons, and they should be followed.
On October 6, 1789, angry crowds of women from the market forced the return of the King Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, their two small children (11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and sister of the King Madame Elisabeth
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd of people who were shouting threats to the king and queen.
The crowd of people forced the King and Queen wide open windows.
At some point one of the participants of this mob waved his hand to the king's guard killed in Versailles on the eyes of the terrified queen.
The US military expenditures on the Philippines paid for themselves by the Filipinos.
They had to pay taxes to the American colonial regime in order to pay for the large majority of the expenses and interest on the bonds that were being moved by the government of the Philippines through Wall
Of course, the profits derived from the long-term use of the Filipinos were the main source of American imperialism's income.
To understand the Templars, we need to understand the context that prompted them to create the order.
The period in which these events took place is called the High Middle Ages, a period of European history that covers the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
High Middle Ages replaced earlier Middle Ages and preceded the later Middle Ages, which, according to the accepted view, ended around 1500.
Technological determinism - is a term, covering a wide range of practical ideas, from technological progress or technological imperative to strict point of view, that fates of people are driven by the fundamental logic of science and its manifestation in technologies
Most of the views on technological determinism share two common ideas: that the direction of technological development is virtually uncontrollable by cultural or political influences and that, in turn, "influence" of technologies on society is determined by their own properties
For example, you could say that the automobile is a necessary cause of the development of roads.
However, the national road network is economically unprofitable only for a small group of cars, so new methods of production are being developed to reduce the cost of ownership of the car.
Mass ownership of cars also leads to an increase in the number of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new methods of treating the injuries received on the road.
Romanticism was a major influence on the cultural determinism, drawn from the works of Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time, there developed associated with it customs and culture, which, in harmony with the place of residence of the society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws." #
Like Paris is the capital of fashion in the modern world, so Constantinople was the capital of fashion in the Middle Ages.
His fame as a center of luxury spread about 400 B.C. and continued until about 1100 B. C.
His status was declining during the twelfth century mainly because of the Crusaders returning with such gifts as silk and spices, which were more valuable than those offered on the Byzantine markets.
At this moment and the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the X and the XI century.
At first, clothing was under the strong influence of Byzantine culture on the east.
But because of slow communication channels, Western styles may lag by 25-30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe had developed its own styles. One of the biggest achievements of the time was the use of buttons to fasten clothes.
Natural agriculture is agriculture that is conducted to produce enough food for the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Organic farming is a simple, often organic, system of agriculture, using seeds from the ecosystem in which they grow, along with the use of rotational cropping and other relatively simple methods of increasing yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in agriculture for food, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded people who feel marginalized by the standards of society and allow them to define for themselves who they are.
There are differences between subcultures, due to age, nationality, social status, place of residence and/or sexual orientation of people from which it consists.
The characteristics that define a subculture as an individual, may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
A subculture often asserts its identity through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, including through fashion, manners, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to illustrate several tragic cases when children were not able to contact with adults during their adulthood.
These children are called "wild" or "wildlings". Some wildlings were isolated by people (usually their own parents). In some cases, such an abandonment of their child was the result of the parents' rejection
Street children may have experienced severe forms of violence or trauma before escaping or being abandoned.
Others, as is claimed, were raised by animals; some of them lived in the wild on their own.
If he has been completely raised by animals rather than people, a wild child displays the same physical traits (within the physical limitations) as the particular animal that raised him — for example, his fear or indifference to people.
In contrast to traditional training methods, the concept of the SCOFFLONG method is simpler and more interesting, but it is ahead of many technologies.
Scaffling is not a method of teaching, but rather a form of support for those who are going through a new experience of learning, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffling can be either virtual or real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffling, but also she is a Sticky Note in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scanning, which helps in learning, is built into the software and is designed to remind, explain, and ask questions about procedures that might be too difficult for the learner to handle on their own.
Children are often transferred to foster care for a variety of reasons: from being abandoned to being abused and even extorted.
Children should not grow up in an environment where there is no care, education and upbringing, but they do.
We consider the foster care system safe for children.
Our child welfare system should provide safe housing, loving parents, stable education and reliable health care.
Patronage education should provide all the needs that were lacking in the house where they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique features of the Internet lead to additional scales in terms of approach to use and satisfaction.
So, it is suggested that "learning" and "socialization" are important motivating factors for Internet use (James et al., 1995
Personal involvement" and "long-term relationships" were also named by Eames and McCord (1998) as new dimensions of motivation when they studied how people respond to web sites
Video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions — movements of the face for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can determine whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting his microexpressions.
In the article "President's Speech" Oliver Sacks described how people with damaged brains can still understand speech, but they can correctly assess the sincerity of the
According to his theory, such abilities may be possessed by animals, for example, domestic dogs.
Studies conducted in the twentieth century showed that there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
A mutation introduces a new genetic variant, while selection removes it from the set of manifested variants.
Segregation and recombination with every generation of the two pools are reshaping the variations between them.
In the savanna, the primates with the digestive system like that of man, are unable to meet their nutritional needs by the available plant resources.
In addition, failure to implement this will have such serious consequences as slow growth, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The most accessible plant resources would be proteins found in leaves and legumes, but they are poorly absorbed by such prey as we are, if they are not prepared.
In contrast, animal-based food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest but also represents a rich source of proteins containing all the essential amino acids." #
Given all that has been said, it should come as no surprise that our ancestors decided to "meat" the problem of "protein" in the same way that chimpanzees
Sleep interruption is a process of intentional awakening during normal sleep and subsequent re-sleeping within a short period (10–60 minutes).
It is easy to do this by a relatively quiet alarm clock so that you can wake up and still be fully awake.
If you find out that you are resetting your alarm clock while you are sleeping, you can set it on another side of the room so that you will wake up and turn it off." #
Other options based on biological rhythms include drinking large amounts of water (for example, water or tea known as a diuretic) before bedtime, which forces you to get up to urinate.
The amount of internal peace of a person is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in his body and mind.
When battery voltage is lower than 4.8V, the more positive energy present in you. Everyone has the potential to find absolute rest and a deep sense of satisfaction.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negative attitude.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has been enriched by the Mahayana path of love and a number of techniques of Indian yoga.
The principle of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of unconditional love.
Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
The heart of Tibetan meditation is Yoga of the Gods. By visualizing various deities, cleanse the energy channels, activate the chakras and achieve enlightenment of consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to the cooperation of the Soviet Union and the United States. After the war, the differences regarding the system, process and culture led to the conflict between the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
She would have to last for the next 40 years. She fought in the war in real life, using indirect armies, on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba and in many other places around the world.
By September 17th, the Polish defences had been breached, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian front.
However, these plans became obsolete practically overnight, when around 800 000 Soviet Red Army soldiers formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the occupation of the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga peace agreement, the Soviet-Polish pact of non-aggression, and other international agreement
The use of ships for transporting goods is, of course, the most effective way of transporting a large number of people and goods across oceans.
The traditional work of sailors is to ensure the country’s ability to move its people and goods, as well as to prevent the enemy’s ability to move its people and goods.
One of the most interesting recent examples of this was the Atlantic crossing by the Americans during the Second World War. They tried to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German naval force, using mainly their submarines, tried to stop this movement.
If the anti-Hitler coalition had failed, Germany, most probably, could have won Britain as well as other European countries.
Cows, it is believed, were domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros mountains.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to leave them to have on hand milk, wool, meat and skin.
In the past, the domestic goats were usually kept in herds, which wandered around the hills or other grazing areas, where the herdsmen usually were children or teenagers, which looked like a more common activity of a herder. These methods of grazing are still used
The roads for carriages were built in England in the 15th century.
While the wagon roads were merely laid parallel to the logs, they gave horses the ability to carry heavier loads and at a faster rate than on slightly more bumpy roads of the time.
The rails were first used for a long time to keep the rails in place. However, it became apparent that the tracks were more effective when the track was made of iron.
It is now a common practice, but iron was more prone to wear wooden wheels on wagons.
As time went by, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first rails were made entirely of iron.
The first known form of transport was walking, people started walking straight two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning a straight man).
For their ancestors, australopithecines, walking straight was not so common.
Bipedal specializations are found in the remains of australopithecines from the period of 4,2–3,9 million years ago, although, perhaps, the sahelanthropus walked on
We can start living, more caring about the environment. We can become members of environmental movements and even be activists to help at least a little bit ease the suffering of the future." #
This is often like treating the symptoms. If we need a temporary fix, we need to find the root cause and fix it.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed dramatically due to the advances in science and technology of mankind, and because of the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of people,
After the House of Representatives passed the 4th of July, a draft signed by the Chairman of the House John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson was sent to the printing shop of John Dun
In one night, 150–200 copies were made known as "Dale's leaflets".
The first public reading of this document was made by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
On July 6, one copy was sent to George Washington, who 9 July ordered it read before his troops in New York. The copy arrived in London 10 August.
25 leaflets of Danley, known to the present day, are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not reached us.
Today many paleontologists believe that one of the dinosaur groups survived and lived to this day. We call them birds.
They are often overlooked as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But you can still say a lot about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have claws and clawed feet, they lay eggs and walk on two hind legs like a tiger.
Every computer that is used today is based on the processing of information that is encoded in binary form.
A binary number can have only one of two values, that is, 0 or 1. These numbers are called "binary digits" — or "bits", if you use computer-speak
It is difficult to diagnose a poisoning from the oral route immediately. Such symptoms, such as vomiting, are too general for a quick diagnosis.
The best sign of an internal poisoning is the presence of an open container of medication or a toxic household chemical.
Look at the label, where you will find special instructions on first aid in case of poisoning by this specific poison.
The term ‘bug’ is used by entomologists formally to refer to a group of insects.
This concept comes from the ancient times of bed bugs - insects that are well adapted to parasitism on humans.
And scavengers, and bedbugs are nest-living species, adapted to live in the nest or home of their host.
According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 400 thousand cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) are diagnose
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and the optic nerve.
Research shows that women are more likely to suffer from MS than men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or that their child's interests are not being met.
These couples can choose to create a plan for adoption of their child.
When a child is adopted or adopted by a biological parent, the biological parent refuses to have parental rights in order to allow another couple to take the child.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world works, by applying the scientific method. This method is the basis of most scientific research.
But he is not the only one. Research also follows experimentation (experimentation is a test used to exclude one or more possible hypotheses), asking questions and conducting observations.
Naturalist and philosophers turned their attention to anti-Christian texts and especially to the Latin Bible.
In all scientific questions, including psychology, were accepted the views of Aristotle.
As Greek language skills deteriorated, Western civilization was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the observed rhythms in physiology and behaviour are to a large extent dependent on the presence of endogenous circadian rhythms and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, not being simply a response to external periodic stimuli, have been recorded in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to autonomous oscillations for a period of time even without external stimuli.
The experiment of Hershey and Chase was one of the first ideas that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase implanted their DNA into bacteria with the help of phages, which are viruses.
They performed two experiments, labeling the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus and labeling the phage protein with radioactive iodine.
Mutations can result in a large number of different results depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the mutated segment of the genetic material, and whether the mutated cells are embryonic stem cells.
Only mutations in the germ line can be passed on to the next generation, while mutations somewhere else can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism is interesting for those who love to travel to the countryside, to enjoy the landscape, including wild animals and plants.
In the list of activities available at the hotel - hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
An example of this is the visit, photographing and studying orangutans in Borneo.
Each morning people leave small towns in the countryside to go to their place of work, while passing by those whose place of work is located from where they just left.
In this highly active transport system, every one is connected to the personal car system and supports it.
In the present day, science has shown that the enormous fossil fuel economy has had a major impact on one of the stable states of the biosphere that has supported human evolution for the past two
Everyone is a member of society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about these systems.
You rarely hear such complaints about water quality or falling bridges in developed countries.
Why are there so many complaints about transport systems, why do they break down every day? Is it because transport engineers are incompetent? Or there are more fundamental reasons?
The study of individual drivers and vehicles movement between two points and their interaction with one another is carried out within the study of traffic flow.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the intensity of traffic, because it is not possible to predict the behavior of the driver.
It is fortunate that drivers’ behaviour is often quite consistent; thus, the overall flow of traffic can be approximated mathematically.
To better represent the transport flow, relationships were established between three main variables: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relations help in planning, designing and operation of railway structures.
Insects were the first animals to rise into the air. Their ability to fly helped them to escape from enemies, find food and partners.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings along their bodies, which gives them an advantage.
This provides them with more hiding places, where they can hide from predators.
Spiders and flies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Many years ago, Aristotle said that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
Many people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the Solar System revolves around Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
It seems like a good idea, because we don’t feel that the Earth is moving, do you?
The Amazon River is the second longest river in the world and the first in terms of volume. It carries more than eight times more water than the second largest river on Earth.
The Amazon is the widest river in the world, with its width sometimes reaching six miles.
20 percent of the water that flows from rivers on our planet to the oceans flows from the Amazon.
The Amazon River has a length of 6387 km (3980 miles). It is fed by thousands of small rivers.
However, despite the fact that the construction of the pyramids of stones continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical perfection of the pyramids at Giza have never been surpass
In the new kingdom of ancient Egyptians they were enthralled by monuments created by their predecessors for thousands of years.
The population of the Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and also the smallest population country.
In the Vatican, the Italian language is used in legislation and official communications.
The Italian language is also a daily language for most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Catholics.
Many people have known the basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver and copper, because they can be found in nature in pure form and relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle believed that all things are composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. It was earth, water, air, and fire.
They were like four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, though he also conjectured that they would change into a new state, to produce what we see.
Composites are mixtures of two or more metals. Remember that in the periodic table there are many elements.
The elements calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also make such alloys that contain small amounts of such nonmetallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter consists of minute particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them can fit in the end of this sentence.
In other words, the pencil has become a good friend for many people when it was invented.
It is sad that when new ways of writing were invented, pencil lost its former status and they are less used.
People now write messages on screens of computers, and they never have to deal with a sharpener.
You can only guess what will happen to the keyboard, as new technologies are introduced.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that for the number of protons and neutrons to be in one nucleus, energy is required.
Like pushing a heavy trolley up a hill. Then the reprocessing of the core releases some of this energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they are prone to decay under little or no influence.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km under the oceans and 100 km under the continents.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the mountains.
The visible side can be more moon seas, because the crust is thinner. The waves were easier to climb up.
Content theories focus on the search for what makes people act or might interest them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that accumulate over time.
These theories turn to what makes specific people want to do what they do, and what their surroundings makes them do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories of content - the "Pyramid of Needs" and "Gertzberg's Motivational Theory.
Typically, two types of behavior can occur when managers begin to manage people, previously equal to them in status. One extreme is trying to remain "one's own man" (or woman).
Those managers are difficult to take unpopular decisions, disciplinary measures, evaluate the results of work, assign duties and to punish employees.
On the other end of the spectrum, the individual becomes a non-recognizable individual, who feels that he must change everything that the team did, and take it over.
Because the leader ultimately bears responsibility for the success or failure of the team.
This conduct often leads to conflicts between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams apply the same standards of excellence as normal teams, but there are small differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their direct physical team.
They are usually more autonomous than traditional employees, because their teams can meet at different time zones, which can not always understand local management.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (LaRosa and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also unique to virtual teams.
The invisible team" is a team of leaders that reports to each participant. The invisible team sets standards for each participant.
Why would an organization go through the tedious process of creating an adaptive organization? One of the goals of applying the concepts of adaptive organizations is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively used throughout all functional areas of an organization, creativity and inventiveness can be manifested.
In the end, a united effort by the organization to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovative process that will be in the interests of the customer.
Before an organization can become innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation, knowledge exchange and experience accumulation.
Engel (2006, p. 58) explains the approach "Continuum" as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of efficiency.
The data of neurobiology provide physical evidence for the theoretical approach to studying consciousness. Thus, the area of research is narrowed, and it becomes much more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior is used by scientists in their studies.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, injuries, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some psychological functions.
The introduction of new technologies allows us to see and explore unseen previously structures and processes of the brain.
This provides us with a large amount of data and materials for the creation of simulation models that help us understand the processes taking place in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence is often associated with science fiction, it is a very important area of computer science that studies the behavior and learning of machines and "infusing" them with intelligence.
AI research includes the creation of machines for automating tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
Here are some examples that can be cited: control, planning and creating a schedule, response to diagnoses and questions of the client, as well as recognition of face, handwriting and voice.
These questions are dealt with in separate courses, aimed at solving the problems we face in everyday life.
The AI system is now being used in a variety of economic, medical, engineering and military fields, being embedded in some software applications for home computers and video games.
Educational excursions are very important for any class. It is often teachers want to take their students to places where buses can not go.
The technology offers a solution by means of virtual tours. Students can explore museum exhibits, visit the aquarium or enjoy the beautiful art sitting with their class.
Updating the tour on the virtual space for all to see is also a great way to refresh your memories of the tour and share your knowledge with future classes.
For example, every year students at Bennet High School in North Carolina create a website about their visit to the capital of their state, and each year that site is updated, but access to the old versions is still preserved — they serve
Blogs can also improve writing skills among students. Although students often start their blog using poor grammar and spelling, this usually changes as a result of the presence of an audience.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to strive to improve his or her letter in order to avoid criticism.
Also, blogging, "students begin to better understand the world around them. Students are inspired to be smart and interesting, drawing attention to themselves (Toto, 2004).
Bloggership is an instrument that stimulates cooperation, and it motivates students to spread the process of acquiring knowledge far beyond the traditional school day.
Using blogs can give students the opportunity to become more analytical and critical. By actively responding to internet-based materials, students can determine their position in the context of other students' work, and they can also express their own views on specific issues (O'
Ottawa is a delightful bilingual capital of Canada with a large number of art galleries and museums that open the past and present of Canada.
On the south is Niagara Falls, and the north is the domain of untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and its surrounding areas.
All of this and much more makes Ontario something truly Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
The great areas further north are seldom settled, and some of them are almost uninhabited wilderness.
Astonishing comparison of the number of people: in the United States more African Americans than Canadians.
East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean near the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is much more than other countries and is a unique continent in that respect.
Almost all of the smaller islands are independent states or associated with France and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to this region, especially it has been established on the Comoros and Mayotte islands.
The spread of European influence and colonization began in the 14th century, when Vasco da Gama discovered the way through the Cape of Good Hope from Europe to India.
Northern region is bounded by Sahara Desert, on the south and west by Atlantic Ocean.
For women: all tourists are advised to say that they are married, regardless of their current marital status.
Also useful is to wear a ring (not too expensive in appearance).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can make them feel harassed, women are often pursued, grabbed by the hand and so on.
Stand firm and don't be afraid to stand up for your man (this is not acceptable regardless of cultural differences).

When the weather is bad enough to make it difficult to drive, snow can fall in a very short space of time.
Visibility may also be limited due to snow, ice, condensation or frost on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, the weather conditions with snow and ice are normal in many countries, and the traffic continues almost year-round without breaks.
Safari is, perhaps, the biggest lure for tourists in Africa and the main event for many travelers.
The term "safari" in everyday use means a land trip with the purpose of seeing the breathtaking wildlife of Africa, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants or giraffes, often approach vehicles, so that with ordinary equipment you can get a good view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards sometimes are shy, and you will be able to see them better through a binocular.
Hiking safaris (also known as "tree-top walk", "hiking safari" or "walking safari") consist of a hike of a few hours to several days.
