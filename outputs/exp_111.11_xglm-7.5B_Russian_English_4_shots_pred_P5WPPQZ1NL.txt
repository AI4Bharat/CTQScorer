Of the 1400 people surveyed in the run-up to federal elections in 2010, the number of those who are opposed to Australia becoming a republic has risen from 2008 by 8 percent.
The acting prime minister Julia Gillard during the federal election campaign in 2010 expressed the view that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34% of respondents share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to become the last monarch of Australia.
The following results were obtained: 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should accede to the Commonwealth as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that it does not need this form of government.

Gold can be shaped into any shape. It can be cut into very small shapes.
It can be drawn out in thin wire, which can be twisted and braided. It can be made of brass or twisted into rolls.
It can be made very thin and attached to another metal. It can be made so thin that sometimes it was used for decoration of hand-painted illustrations in books – the so-called "frontispiece".
It is called pH of a chemical substance. You can make an indicator by using the juice of red cabbage.
Tomato juice changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH-value of the substance is determined by the concentration of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the substance.
Ions of hydrogen are protons, which are separated from electrons (hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Get a new mixture, mixing two dry powders in one container, and then wet your hands and make a ball out of this mixture.

In almost every city of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro there was a toilet with a flush, connected to a complex sewer
The remains of the sewer systems that were found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece." #
Toilets were also in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets sometimes were part of public baths, where men and women were washed together
When you call someone thousands of miles away from you, you use satellite.
Satellite in space receives a call and almost instantly reflects it back down.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because of the atmosphere of the Earth in some way distorts our light and view
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, you need a giant rocket that is over 100 feet tall.
The wheel has changed our world in a way that is truly amazing. The most important thing it has done for us, is given us a much easier and faster transportation." #
It gave us a train, a car and many other transport vehicles.
Underneath them are more medium-sized cats that eat smaller prey from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, many small cats (including roaming domestic cats) eat and hunt on much larger animals, such as insects, rodents, snakes and birds.
Their secret of success is the niche concept, the special work that each cat does, keeping it from competition with other cats.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
The pride contains one to three adult males, in close kinship, and females and their offspring, which can number up to thirty.
The females usually live together in close kinship and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
The lion prides behave very much like packs of wolves or dogs — animals that are very similar to lions (but not other large cats) and are also very dangerous for their prey.
Being a complete athlete, tiger can climb trees (although not very well), swim, jump over large distances and pull with five strong men.
The tiger belongs to the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones who can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like a full-throated roar of a lion, but more like a word-spouting.
Ornithologists love to eat small animals. If an opportunity presents itself, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, lizards and birds. Almost all the animals that the ornithologist hunts are much smaller than him.
Scientists believe that otters follow the tracks of animals and find their prey by smell, tracking their movements on the ground.
They are able to see in the dark with night vision and almost undetectable move.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) separates from the main population from which they originated (for example, if they cross a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment than that in which they were previously.
The new environment has other resources and other competitors, so the new population will need other characteristics or changes, compared to those that it had before, to become a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed - it still needs the same adaptations as before.
As the new population adapts to the new environment, it becomes less and less like the rest of the population.
Over time, through thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will look so different that one cannot say that they are the same species.
We call this process the formation of species, which is the essential consequence of evolution and is very important.
Plants produce oxygen, which the human breathes, and absorb carbon dioxide, which the human exhales.
Plants feed on sunlight by photosynthesis. In addition, they cast shadows.
We build our houses and make clothes from plants. The vast majority of our food is plants. Without plants, animals would not have survived.
The Mosasaur was the most feared predator of his time, so he was not afraid of anyone but other Mosasaurs.
His long jaws were lined with more than 70 sharp teeth, and there was a further row on the tongue, so that those who met him were doomed.
We know for sure that his language was split, but we don't know if it was a carnivore or a herbivore.
He also attacked everything that entered the water; even the giant dinosaur, such as the Tyrannosaurus Rex, was not in comparison with him.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their own strange and unusual dishes served at banquets. For example, the boar, the peacock, the snails and the so-called'snow leopard
There was another difference: while the poor people and women ate sitting on chairs, the rich people liked to have joint feasts, during which they ate lying on their sides.
The Roman diet could not include foods that were imported from America or Asia in the following centuries.
In particular, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Romans had tried beef.
Babylonians built each god a main temple, considered to be the dwelling of the god.
People sacrificed to the gods, and priests tried to please the gods on rituals and festivals.
Each church had an open courtyard and a sanctuary inside which priests could not enter.
Often temples were built with special towers in the form of pyramids called "Ziggurats.
The top of the tower was a special shrine for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house did not have any special significance.
The majority of Jewish life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were open shelves, which were out of the street. For the construction of houses was used stone.
There were no great forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Grenada was sparsely populated. In the Scandinavian sagas, it is said that Eric the Red was expelled from Iceland for murder and, advancing further west, he opened Grenada and gave

He was under the command of the Vichy French. These French, who signed a peace treaty with the Germans in 1940, worked together with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France. The invasion was called "Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Free French and the Americans liberated southern France and went to Germany.
Civilization is a separate culture, the culture of a large group of people living and working together, society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin "civis", which means "citizen" and is related to the Latin words civis, meaning "citizen", and civitas, meaning "city" or "city-state". It
Cities-states are the precursors of nations. Civilizational culture involves the transmission of knowledge through several generations, a continuous cultural presence and a reproducible spread.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving any historical evidence, and therefore cannot be recognized as authentic civilizations.
In the War of Independence, thirteen states, in accordance with Articles of Confederation, first formed a weak central government, the only body of which was the Congress.
The Congress had no authority to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on the powers of the states, which often refused to cooperate and not enforce its acts.
He also had no authority to abolish state tax laws and tariffs.
To amend the articles, it is necessary for unanimous approval of all the states, but the states have so disregarded the central government that their representatives seldom

The forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan in 1885 and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after the defeat in China-Japan War (1894-1895), the Chinese government signed the Sino-Japanese Treaty, which ceded Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Sun Temple and the Three Windows Room.
Most of the buildings on either side of the complex were reconstructed to give tourists a more accurate idea of how they looked originally.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu was restored. The restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common format for static photos is 35 mm, and that was the dominant size of film on the setting of analogue photography.
Today it is still produced, but more important is that the aspect ratio of the images of digital cameras inherited.
The 35-mm format is a bit confusing, it has a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
Aspect ratio of this format is divided into two parts, so it is called 3:2.
Many common formats (for example the APS format family) are equal or close to these proportions.
A simple third rule is a simple recommendation that creates dynamism, while maintaining a certain degree of order in the image.
It says that the best place to place the main object is at the intersection of lines dividing the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see the
In this period of European history, the Catholic church, becoming rich and powerful, was the object of intense scrutiny.
Christianity united European countries despite the differences in languages and traditions.
Her all-encompassing power touched everyone - from the king to the common man.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to ease suffering and poverty, and that the church's money exists to this end.
The center of the church's authority was based in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth led to the question of whether this dogma was being observed.
In the immediate aftermath of the war, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
This strategy has proven its effectiveness, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated all of the international laws that have been accepted universally over the past two centuries.
Britain has detonated international waters, so that ships cannot enter whole sectors of the oceans, putting at risk even neutral ships.
Because the response to this tactic was cautious, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine operations.
In the 1920s, among the majority of citizens and nations, there were such sentiments as pacifism and isolation.
Learning the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, states wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America, and accepted the offer to work in the company Edison in New York City.

In ancient China, they used a unique way to indicate periods of time; each stage of China or each family in power was a special dynasty.
In addition, between dynasties there was fragmentation and instability. The most famous period of the Three Kingdoms was 60 years during the dynasties of Han and Qin.
In this period, there were fierce battles between many noble people vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting for the throne in a large palace in Xi'an." #

As well as after the Revolution, opportunities opened up for all men, which allowed the most ambitious and talented to achieve success.
The same applies to the army, because ranks have been based on qualities, not on origin.
French Revolution also inspired many other pressed workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in topics, not related to worldly life. He often visited the cave which became known as "Hira" on the mountain "Nur" (light)
And the cave that is still in existence today, gives us a vivid picture of the spiritual aspirations of Muhammad.
The cave is located on the top of a mountain to the north of Mecca and completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It is very difficult to find even to the person who knows about its existence. In the cave, the person is isolated from the outside world.
There is nothing but pure beautiful sky above your head and a multitude of surrounding mountains. From the depths of the cave you can see and hear only a very small part of this world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century BC and is one of the many great pyramids built to honor the Pharaoh.
Great Pyramid of Giza, or the Great Pyramid of Giza, in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid of Giza is the largest), several small tombs, several temples and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Haps, and many smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of his wives and his relatives.
Sign of the hammer's movement up is like V, and the movement of the hammer down is like a square without a bottom.
Up" means that you have to start with the tip of your finger and move the pick up forward, and "down" means that you have to start with the place where your hand holds the pick up and move it back.
The upstroke is usually softer than the downstroke, while the downstroke is more forceful and louder.
You can draw your own stroke, but remember that the stroke is printed on musical reasons, and it usually should be followed.
On October 6, 1789, angry crowd of women from the market forced the return of the king, the queen, their two little children (11-year-old Mary-Teresa and 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and the sister of the king, Madame Elisabeth, to

The military expenditures of the American imperialism on the conquest of the Philippines paid for themselves by the Filipinos.
They had to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to pay for the large part of the expenses and interest on the bonds that were moved by the government of the Philippines through banks in Wall Street
Of course, the profits brought by the long exploitation of the Filipinos were the main income of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you must understand the context that prompted them to create the order.
The period in which these events took place is called the High Middle Ages, a period of European history that covers the XI, XII and XIII centuries (1000–1300 B.C.).
High Middle Ages replaced the earlier Middle Ages and preceded the later Middle Ages, which, according to the accepted view, ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that covers a wide range of practical ideas, from technological progress or technological imperative to a strict point of view that fates of people are driven by the underlying logic of science and its manifestation in technologies.
The majority of views on technological determinism share two common ideas: that the direction of technological development is virtually uncontrollable by cultural or political influences and that, in turn, "influence" of technology on society is determined by its own properties
For example, one could say that the automobile is an essential cause of the development of roads.
However, the national road network is economically unfeasible for only a small group of cars, so new methods of production are being developed to reduce the cost of ownership of the car.
Mass car ownership also leads to an increase in road accidents, which leads to the invention of new methods of treatment of injuries received on the road.
Romanticism in many respects included cultural determinism, drawn from such writers as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
Geography formed people, and over time, there developed associated with it customs and culture, which, in harmony with the place of residence of this society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Like Paris is the capital of fashion in the modern world, so Constantinople was the capital of fashion in the medieval Europe.
His fame as a centre of luxury spread about 400 BC and continued for about 1100 BC.
His status was lowered during the 12th century mainly because of the Crusaders returning with such gifts as silk and spices, which were more valuable than those offered on the Byzantine markets." #
And at that moment the title of the Capital of Fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak in the period between X–XI and XIV centuries.
At first, clothing was influenced by Byzantine culture on the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, western styles may lag behind by 25-30 years.
Own styles began to develop in Western Europe towards the end of the Middle Ages. One of the biggest achievements of that time was the use of buttons to fasten clothes.
Natural agriculture is agriculture that is conducted to produce enough food for the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Natural agriculture is a simple, often organic, system of agriculture, using seeds of the plants that grow in this ecosystem, together with the use of rotational and other relatively simple methods of increasing yield.
Historically, it has been so that most farmers were engaged in agriculture for the purpose of sustenance, and that is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite people who feel marginalized by the mainstream society, and allow them to define themselves.
There are differences between subcultures, due to age, nationality, social status, place of residence and/or gender, from which it consists.
The characteristics that define a subculture as an individual, may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Representatives of a certain subculture often declare their membership through a symbolic and distinctive use of style, including through fashion, manners and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to illustrate several unfortunate cases where children were not able to contact with adults during their adulthood.

Children living on the streets, it is possible that they have suffered from severe forms of violence or trauma before escaping or being abandoned.
Some of them were raised by animals; some of them lived in the wild.
If he is raised entirely by animals, a wild child displays the same traits (within physical limits) as those of a particular animal raised by him — for example, his fear or indifference to people.
While project-based learning should be more fun and interesting, scaffolding is ahead of many technologies.
Scaffling is not a method of teaching, but rather a form of support for those who are going through a new experience of learning, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffling can be as virtual, as well as real. In other words, the teacher is a form of scaffling, but also she is the Sticky Note in Microsoft Office.
Virtual stallioning, helping in learning, is built into the software and is intended to remind, explain and ask questions about procedures, which may be too difficult for the learner to handle on his own.
Children are handed over to foster care for a variety of reasons: from abduction to cruelty and even extortion.
Children should not grow up in a situation where they are not provided with care, education and a good upbringing, but they do
We regard the foster care system as safe for children.
Our system of care should provide safe housing, loving guardians, stable education and sound health.
Patronage education should provide all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinguishing features of the Internet lead to additional scales in terms of approach to use and satisfaction.
In other words, it is suggested that "learning" and "socialization" are important motivating factors for using the Internet (James et al
Personal involvement" and "long-term contacts" were also named by Eames and McCord (1998) as new dimensions of motivation when they studied how people react to web sites
Video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions — movements of the face for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can determine whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting his microexpressions.
In the article "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks described how people who have suffered brain damage are unable to understand speech, but can correctly assess the sincerity of
According to his theory, such abilities may be possessed by animals, for example, domestic dogs.
Studies conducted in the twentieth century showed that there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
A mutation introduces a new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the pool of visible variations.
Segregation and recombination with each generation are reshaping the variations between two pools.
In the savanna, the herbivores have such digestive systems as ours, and they are unable to meet their nutritional needs by using the available plant resources.
In addition, failure to meet this will lead to such serious consequences as slowing growth, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The most accessible plant-based resources would be proteins found in leaves and legumes, but they are poorly absorbed by such prey as us, if they are not prepared properly.
In contrast, animal-based food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest but also a rich source of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
Taking into account all of the above, it's not surprising that our ancestors decided "protein" problems approximately as they do today in the savannah.
Sleep interruption is a process of intentional awakening during the normal sleep and subsequent re-sleeping within a short time (10–60 minutes).
This can be done with a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up and still not wake you up completely.
If you find that you reinstall your alarm clock while you are asleep, you can set it up on the other side of the room so that you will wake up to turn it off." #
Other options based on biological rhythms include drinking large amounts of water (for example, water or tea known as a diuretic) before going to bed, which forces you to get up to go to the toilet.
The amount of internal peace of a person is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in his body and mind.
Lower the voltage, the more positive the presence of your life force. Everyone has the potential to achieve absolute peace and a sense of satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negative attitude.
Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but was enriched with the Mahayana path of love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
The principle of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
The heart of Tibetan meditation is Yoga of the Gods. By visualizing various gods, the channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and one achieves enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. After the war, disagreements regarding the system, process and culture led to discord between countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
She had to last for forty years. In her there fought in real life, using indirect armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba and many other places in the world.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defences had been breached, and the only hope was retreat and reorganization along the Romanian front.
However, these plans became obsolete practically overnight, when more than 800 000 Soviet Red Army soldiers formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the seizure of eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga peace agreement, the Soviet-Polish pact of non-aggression, and other
The use of ships for transporting goods is by far the most effective way of transporting large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The traditional work of sailors is to ensure the country's ability to move its people and goods, as well as to prevent the enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
One of the most interesting recent examples of this was the company in the North Atlantic during World War II. Americans tried to transport people and materials through the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German naval fleet, using mainly its submarines, tried to stop this movement.
If the anti-Hitler coalition had failed, Germany, most probably, could have won Britain as well as other European countries.
Elephants, it is believed, were domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to leave them to have milk, wool, meat and skin.
Home goats, typically, were kept in herds that wandered around hills or other pastures, which were often watched by herders, who were usually children or teenagers, which is similar to the more common activity of a shepherd.
The roads for carts were built in England in the 15th century.
While the wooden roads were merely laid parallel to the logs, they gave horses the opportunity to carry heavier loads and faster than on slightly more bumpy roads of the time.
Slabs were first used to hold rails in place, but it became clear that the tracks were more effective when laid with a steel rail above.
It has become a common practice, but iron caused more wear on wooden wheels of wagons.
As time went by, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first rails were made entirely of iron.
The first known form of transport was walking, people started walking straight two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means straight man).
For their ancestors, australopithecines, walking upright was not so common.
Bipedal specializations are found in australopithecine remains from the period of 4,2–3,9 million years ago, although, it is possible that the sahelanthropus walked on two
We can start living more caring about the environment. We can be members of the environmental movement and even can be activists to help at least a little bit ease the suffering of the future.

After the adoption of the Congress on July 4th, a manuscript draft signed by the Chairman of the Congress John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thompson was sent to the printing shop of John Dun
In the course of the night, 150 - 200 copies were made known as "Dante's flyers".
The first public reading of this document was made by John F. Kennedy in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8, 1963.
6 July one copy was sent to George Washington, who 9 July ordered it read before his troops in New York. The copy arrived in London 10 August.
25 copies of Danleap's pamphlets, known to us at the present time, are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not
Today many paleontologists believe that one of the dinosaur groups survived and lived to this day. We call them birds.
Often they are not considered dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly.
But there is still much to say about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have claws and scales, they lay eggs and walk on two hind legs like a tiger.
Almost all computers that are used today are based on information that is encoded in binary form.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. "0" or "1". These numbers are called "binary digits" — or "bits", if

The best sign of an internal poisoning is the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemical.
Read the label, where you will find instructions on how to provide first aid in case of poisoning with this specific poison.
The term "bug" is used by entomologists formally to denote a group of insects.
This concept comes from the ancient times bed bugs - insects that are well adapted to parasitism on the human.
And scavengers, and bed bugs are egg-laying species, adapted to life in the nest or the home of their owner.
According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately 400 thousand cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) are diagnosed each year
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and the optic nerve." #
Studies have shown that there are twice as many women as men suffering from the disease of multiple sclerosis.
The couple may decide that raising a child is not in their child's best interest or their child's best interest.
These couples may choose to create a plan for adoption for their child.
When a child is adopted or adopted by another couple, biological parents give up their parental rights in order that another couple may take the child.
The main purpose of science is to discover how the world works, by applying the scientific method. This method is the basis of most scientific research.
He is not the only one. Scientific research also follows experimentation (experimentation is a test used to exclude one or more possible hypotheses), asking questions and observing.
Naturalist and philosophers concentrated their attention on anti-Christian texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
In all scientific questions, including psychology, Aristotle's views were adopted.
As knowledge of Greek language deteriorated, Western civilization was cut off from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many of the observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are significantly influenced by the presence of endogenous circadian rhythms and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, not simply a response to external periodic stimuli, are registered by most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to autonomously oscillate for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the first hypotheses that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey's with Chase's DNA were implanted into a bacteria with the help of phages, i.e. viruses.
They performed two experiments, labeling radioactive phosphorus DNA of the phage and radioactively-stained phage protein.
Mutations can cause a great variety of different results, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the mutated segment of the genetic material and whether the mutated cells are embryonic stem cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations somewhere else can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism is interesting for those who love to travel to the countryside, to enjoy the landscape, including wild animals and plants.
The list of activities includes: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
An example could be visiting, photographing and studying orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave small towns in rural areas to go to their place of work, and by their way pass those whose place of work is located from the place from which they just left.
In this active transport movement, each in some way is connected with the personal car system, and supports it.
At the moment, science is pointing out that the enormous fossil fuel economy has had a major impact on one of the stable states of the biosphere that has supported human evolution for the past two
Everyone is a member of society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about these systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear such complaints about water quality or falling bridges.
Why are there so many complaints about transport systems, why they are constantly breaking down? Is it because transport engineers are incompetent? Or there are more fundamental reasons?
The study of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction with one another is carried out within the study of traffic flows.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the traffic intensity, because it is impossible to predict the behavior of the driver.
Fortunately, drivers' behavior is often quite consistent; thus, traffic flows can be approximated mathematically.
To better understand the transport stream, the relationships between the three main quantities were established: (1) stream, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relations help in planning, designing and operating railway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly helped them to evade enemies, find food and partners.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings along their bodies, giving them an advantage.
It provides them with more hiding places, where they can hide from predators.
Spiders and flies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, the name of Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Many believed that he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars
It seems reasonable to us, because we don’t feel that the Earth is moving, isn’t it?
The Amazon River is the second longest river in the world and the first in terms of volume. It carries more than eight times more water than the second largest river on Earth.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, its width sometimes exceeding six miles.
About 20 percent of the water that flows from rivers on our planet to the oceans flows from the Amazon.
The main river of the Amazon has a length of 6387 km (3980 miles). It flows into thousands of small rivers.
Although the construction of pyramids from stones continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical perfection of the pyramids in Giza have never been surpassed.
In the new kingdom of ancient Egypt, the pharaohs were enthralled by the monuments created by their predecessors for thousands of years ago.
Population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and also the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican uses Italian in legislation and official communications.
Italian language is also a common language for most people working in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of the Vatican are Catholics.
Many people have known the basic elements, such as gold, silver and copper, because they can be found in nature in pure form and relatively easily extracted with primitive tools.
Aristotle believed that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. It was earth, water, air and fire.
They were like four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, though he also suspected that they would transition into a new state, to get what we see.
Alloys are essentially mixtures of two or more metals. Remember that in the periodic table there are many elements.
As well as these elements, calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
It is also possible to make such alloys which contain a small amount of such non-metallic elements as carbon.
All matter in the universe consists of atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them can fit in the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil became a good friend for many people when it was introduced.
It is sad that when new ways of writing were invented, pencil lost its former status and it was less used.
People write messages on screens and never have to deal with a sharpener.
You can only speculate what will happen to the keyboard, as new technologies will soon be available.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that for a large number of protons and neutrons to be in one nucleus, energy is required
Like pushing a heavy trolley up a hill. Then the re-enrichment of the nucleus releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means that they are prone to decay under little or no influence.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km under oceans and 100 km under continents.
It is thinner under the moon's seas and thicker under the mountains.
The visible side of the moon may have more lunar seas, because the crust is thinner there. The waves were easier
Content theories focus on the search for what makes people act or might interest them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that accumulate inside during the process of growing up.
The theories address the reasons why specific people want to do what they do, and why their surroundings make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories of content are the "Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs" and "Gerzberg's Theory of Motivation.
Typically, two types of behavior can be observed when managers begin to manage people, previously equal to them in status. One extreme spectrum is the attempt to remain "their guy" (or girl).
Those managers are hard to take unpopular decisions, disciplinary measures, evaluate results of work, distribute duties and to hold employees accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, the individual becomes a non-recognizable individual, who thinks that he must change everything that the team did and take it over.
Because the leader ultimately bears the responsibility for the success or failure of the team.
This behaviour often leads to conflicts between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams follow the same standards of skill as regular teams, but there are some minor differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their direct physical group.
They are usually more autonomous than traditional teams, because their teams can meet in accordance with different time zones, which is not always understand local management.
The presence of a genuine "invisible team" (LaRosa and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also unique to the virtual team.
Invisible team" is a team of leaders that reports to each player. The invisible team sets standards for each player.
Why would an organization go through the tedious process of creating an adaptive organization? One of the objectives of using self-learning organizations in practice is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively used in all functional departments of the organization, creativity and inventiveness may be manifested.
In the end, a united effort by the organization to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovative process that will be in the client's interest.
Before an organization can become innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation, knowledge exchange and experience accumulation.
Engel (2006) explains the approach "Continuum" as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of effectiveness.
The data from neurobiology give physical evidence for the theoretical approach to studying consciousness. Thus the field of study is narrowed, and it becomes much more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior is being used by scientists in their studies.
It has long been known that various types of damage, injuries, injuries and tumors of the brain affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The introduction of new technologies allows us to see and study the unseen previously structures and processes of the brain.
This provides us with a great amount of data and materials for creating imitational models, helping us understand the processes taking place in our minds.
Although AI is often associated with science fiction, it is a very important area of computer science that considers the behaviour and learning of machines and "instilling" them with intelligence." #
AI research includes the creation of machines for automating tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
Here are some examples that can be cited: control, planning and creating a schedule, reaction to diagnoses and questions from the client, as well as recognizing face, handwriting and voice.
These issues are dealt with in separate disciplines, which are aimed at solving the problems we face in everyday life.
At the present time, artificial intelligence is often used in economics, medicine, engineering and military fields, being embedded in some software applications for home computers and video games.
Study tours are very important for any class. It is very often that teachers want to take their students there, where buses cannot go.
The technology offers a solution by means of virtual tours. Students can view museum exhibits, visit an aquarium or enjoy the beautiful art, sitting with their class.
Updating the tour on the virtual space for the public to see is also a great way to refresh the memory of the tour and share your knowledge with future classes.
For example, each year students from Bennet High School in North Carolina create a website about their visit to the capital of the state, and each year that site is updated, but access to old versions is still available — they serve as a
Blogs can also improve writing skills in students. Although students often start their blog using sloppy grammar and spelling, it usually changes as a result of the presence of an audience.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to strive to improve his writing skills in order to avoid criticism.
In addition, by blogging, "students are inspired to be smart and interesting, drawing attention to themselves (Toto, 2004).
Bloggership is a tool that encourages collaboration and it motivates students to spread the process of acquiring knowledge far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can give students the opportunity to become more analytical and critical. By actively responding to internet materials students can determine their position in the context of other students’ work, as well as to express their own views on specific issues (Oravek
Ottawa is a delightful bilingual capital of Canada with a huge number of art galleries and museums, opening the past and present of Canada.
The next to the south is Niagara Falls, and the north is the domain of untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and its surroundings.
