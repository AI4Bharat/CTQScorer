Philosophy of technological determinism is a word that can mean a wide range of things, from technological shock to technological steps to a strict idea that human destiny is an inherent scientific law and its technological application is the means of its implementation.

For example, someone might say that motor cars are per se for the development of the road.
At least, in a few cases, a road network is economically feasible only for a few cars, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.

In Savanna, the human digestive system is not well suited to the availability of amino acids in plants.
Overall, the failure to make it has led to a sense of despair, malnutrition and other serious problems, and premature death.
Accessible plant resources such as leaves and pods are easily digestible, but they are not suitable for cooking like primates.
Comparatively, animal food (beetle, fly, egg) is easily digested and also contains a lot of protein which contains all the essential amino acids.
When we consider the whole matter, it is not surprising that our ancestors would have solved their protein problem in the same way as the Swayampurians do today.
Sleep disorders occur when the purpose of waking up is to perform an intentional process and to sleep for a short time (10-60 minutes) and then to wake up.
