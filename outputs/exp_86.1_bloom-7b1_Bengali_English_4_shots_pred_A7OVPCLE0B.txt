They also have medium sized dogs which prey on rodents such as hedgehogs, hares and even lions and leopards.
Finally, there are many small dogs (lost dog) who catch small prey such as insects, mice, cockroaches and birds.
The secret of their success is the idea of a suitable location, a special job that protects each cat from competition.
Lions are the most social of all cats, living in large pride groups.
These pride are formed by one to three adult men, thirty women and babies.
They are usually closely associated with each other because of their large family.
Like a pride of lions, they are fierce and deadly to prey, but unlike lions, they are not as large as lions.
A good athlete can climb a tiger (although not well), swim, jump and pull 5 times stronger than a strong human being.
These four species of cat are also capable of making a roar.
The roar of the lion is not like the full voice of a lion, but like a grunting and screaming sound.
They prefer small animals such as rodents, snakes, frogs and birds.
They are thought to follow scents and smell to find their prey, where they would follow the ground while moving.
They can see well at night and move silently. They can blend in with their environment and hunt prey.
When a small population (like a tribe) separates itself from its main population (like a mountain range or a river or a new island where they can easily return) they often find themselves in a different environment.
Competition is more intense in this new environment, so they need to have different characteristics or adaptations to be stronger competitors.
The real demographic transition has not taken place, they still need to adapt to the same way of life.
Time passes, and the new population begins to adapt to their new environment. At the same time, they begin to lose their connection with the other population.
Finally, two populations will be so different that they will no longer be considered the same species.
Speciation is an inevitable outcome and an important part of evolution.

Example, most common film size in the world is 35 mm, which was the most influential film size in the analog film era.
it is still made, but more important is the ratio which digital camera image sensors have inherited from the film format.
Actually, 35MM format is somewhat confusingly, 24MM length 36MM.
Therefore, the approximate ratio (12 divided by simple whole-number ratio) is 3 : 2.
Common formats (for example, APS family formats) are similar or equal to the aspect ratio of the original file.

When the events occurred, the period was called the High Middle Ages in European history.
Pre-medieval and Post-medieval High Middle Ages, which began around 1500 CE and ended around the mid-16th century.
From a technical point of view, it can be a very broad term. It can mean a technological shock or a technological step or a very strict idea that believes that human destiny is an inherent scientific law and that its technological application is the way to lead it.
Overwhelmingly, technological determinism is understood to be twofold: that technology itself is a path that follows and that the technological development has an impact on social conditions rather than on the underlying social conditions.
Example, someone can say that motor vehicles are essential for the development of the road.
At least, in a few cases, the countrywide road network is economically unfeasible, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The majority of people owning cars increases the chances of road accidents. This leads to the development of new strategies for the treatment of injured people.
The cultural direction was determined by the works of such writers as Shakuntala, Gautama, and Fishta.
When it comes to romanticism, geographically bound individuals are involved in the rise of the local customs and culture, and the society of that place, which is better than the imposition of arbitrary laws.
Paris was the fashion capital of the Continent.
By the time it became a center of luxury, it had been around for nearly 400 years and had lasted for nearly 1100 years.
The position of the coin in the 12th century declined primarily because crusaders brought with them silk and spices that were pricier than the market value of the coin.
From this time, fashion has been known as the capital of Paris.
Gothic style was the highest and the most popular style in the 11th and 12th century.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture.
However, the slower communication channels have meant that western customs lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop their own distinct identity. The Crusades had resulted in the use of buckles for clothing, which was one of the largest developments in the time
Agriculture that provides for the livelihood of the farmer and his family.
They cultivate and harvest by using their own needs. It is easy and almost always by the biological method. The maximum yield is obtained by maintaining the same temperature, humidity and solar radiation and the same geographical features in the area where people save seeds and change the crop or other methods of cultivation.
Most of the farmers in the past lived by farming and still some developing countries have that trend.
Interculturalism helps to build a sense of community among those who feel marginalized by social norms and who struggle to define themselves.
Sub-cultures can be distinct based on age, race, class, location and/ or gender.
Characteristics that determine a sub-ethnicity as distinct from the main ethnic group may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of these.
Individual cultures often signal their membership through distinctive and symbolic forms of style, fashion, and language.
Representing the importance of socialization in a few common methods is to create situations in which children are neglected, abused and intentionally mistreated, which prevents them from getting used to grown-ups.
These children are called 'backward' or 'backward'. Some are usually (their own parents) confined to; some cases are rejected by the parents' strong intellectual or physical disabilities.
They may have had to endure much abuse or mental trauma before fleeing or being abandoned.
They are accused of being controlled by animals; some say they live in the forest on their own.
When a child is raised by animals, it often displays behaviors similar to those of animals (such as fear or dislike of humans) as if it were a wild animal.
Project-based learning makes study more interesting and easier, and it is one step further.
scafolding is not a teaching method but a help that helps people who are new to using a new computer program or starting a new project.
These are either real or fake, in other words, the teacher is a form of the paper clip but the small paper clip man from Microsoft Office.
These virtual folders are programmed to insert themselves into the software. These questions that are immediately and quickly answerable by a single student are made easier by the software.

The research in the 20th century showed that there are two aspects of genetic variation : hidden and exposed.
Mutation is the process by which a new genetic variant is added to the population and selection removes it from the population.
Segregation and reconnection help to bring diversity to each generation's pools.
In Savanna, the human-like digestive system of the primates is unable to meet the amino acid requirements of plants.
With all this, it is failing to do it and the stress, malnutrition and other serious problems are growing and premature death is occurring.
The most accessible plant resources are leaves and fruits, but they are not suitable for cooking and are not easily digested by primates.
Comparatively, animal food (prawns, squid, eggs) is only easily accessible and it also contains good amounts of protein which contains all the essential amino acids.
When we consider all the factors, it is not surprising that our ancestors would have solved the protein problem in the same way as the Chinses do in Sivana.
Sleep deprivation is a normal sleep-wake cycle that is purposeful and occurs in a short time (10-60 minutes) after sleep onset.
Comparatively, a peaceful alarm clock can be used to awaken you only partially.
Set the clock back in the night and it might be possible to put it on the other side of the room so that you have to get up to turn it off.
Another alternative is to drink plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known bladder stimulant) before bedtime, which forces one to get up to urinate.

Within two years of the war, old allies had become enemies and cold war had begun.
IT WAS STILL THERE IN THE FUTURE, 40 YEARS LATER, AND THE RENTED ARMY WAS USED TO START THE REAL WAR IN AFRICA, AFGHANISTAN, CUBA, AND OTHER PLACES.
The Polish defence had already broken down and the only hope was to retreat and rebuild on the Romanian bridgehead.

Wagons were used in England in the 16th century.
However, the roadways were only a few parallel wooden planks, and they were not as level as the uneven paths.
Tracks were kept in place by crossings which were put in place in advance. However, gradually it was realized that tracks would be more effective if they were supported by iron stakes.
( b) It became a common practice, but the iron was screwed into the wood of the wagon.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels in 1767. The first fully iron rail was introduced in 1767.
The first transport system was walking. People walked when Homo erectus species people could stand straight on two feet.
They had no natural inclination to walk upright.
At 4.2-3.9 million years ago, the astralopithecus fossil record showed the presence of bipedalism, although it is estimated that Sahelanthropus walked on two feet seven million
Environmentalism is a very important thing. We can be environmental activists. We can even be environmentalists. So that the pain in the future can be reduced a little bit.
It is like symptomatic treatment. But if we don't want to have a temporary solution, we have to find the root cause and we have to get rid of it.
It is clear that the earth has changed considerably as a result of the scientific and technological advances of mankind and the problems have increased due to the excessive population and the extravagant lifestyle of mankind.
The draft was sent to the printer John Dennison, who was located several blocks away, and was signed by the Speaker John Hancock and the Secretary of the House Charles Thomson.
That night 150 to 200 copies were made which are now known as "Dilbar Broadside".
On July 8, Independence Hall, the first public reading of the Nixon papers was held.
One copy was sent to George Washington on June 6, who read it to his troops on July 9, and another copy reached London on August 10.
25 of the Broadside are known as the oldest surviving copies. The original handwritten copy is no longer extant.
Many palaeontologists still believe that dinosaurs survived and still live. We call them birds.

Internal poisoning may not be immediately evident. Symptoms such as vomiting may be common and may be mistaken for other conditions.
The best sign of internal poisoning is the presence of free drug residues or household chemicals.
Check the label of the medicine for the specific treatment of the specified poison.

The main goal of science is to determine how the world works scientifically. This is the direction of scientific research.
Only this is not enough, but it is also a method that can be used to exclude one or more possible hypotheses, to ask questions, and to observe, and to also guide scientific research.
Philosophers and naturalists have been looking at the classical texts and especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle was considered as the founder of all sciences.
They started to deny knowledge of Greece, and thus they started to feel alienated from their own roots.
Physiology and behavioural patterns are often observed to be cyclical and are often produced by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythm, which is not only a response but also a recording of external periodic signals, has been documented in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks have their own self-sustaining oscillators that can run for long periods of time without external input, even when cycling without any external input.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the most important demonstrations that DNA is a genetic material.
Hess and Chas used their own DNA to insert it into a bacterium using phage or virus.
They identified the DNA of the stage through a radioactive phosphate or the protein through a radioactive sulphate.
These changes can have a variety of effects but the effect is dependent on the type of gene change, the importance of the genetic material and the type of cell affected.
Only germline mutations can be carried to the child, somatic mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Interested people are attracted to nature-based tourism destinations for enjoying the natural scenery, flora and fauna.
local activities examples include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and park visits and learning about the environment.
For example, Bornean Orangutan, photography, and learning about them.
They leave their homes in the morning and go to work in the afternoon by car.
Transportation is a system of moving people and goods from one place to another.
science now suggests that this gigantic carbon based economy has thrown the biosphere out of its stable state which has been suitable for human evolution for over 2 million years.
Transportation is a necessity for everyone in society. Everyone complains about the transportation system.
Very few people in developed countries would ever hear about water quality or bridge collapse.
Why do these complaints arise, why do they fail daily? Are transport engineers only incompetent? Or are there other fundamental issues at play?
The traffic flow between two points is the traffic flow between the driver and the vehicle.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to guess the traffic movement because drivers' sense of direction is always certain to be wrong.
However, drivers tend to follow a certain sequence of patterns and this helps in presenting the system mathematically.
Traffic flow is better presented by three main features: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in planning, designing and managing road and transport facilities.
Insects are the first organisms to have flown. Their flight ability helps them to avoid their enemies and to find food and companions more easily.
The majority of insects have the ability to fold their wings behind their bodies.
