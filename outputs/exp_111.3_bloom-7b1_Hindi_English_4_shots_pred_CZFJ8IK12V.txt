When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
Space station calls the satellite and then it returns to earth in the same time.
The satellite was launched from a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere makes some light and vision unusable.
Space for satellites or telescopes needs a rocket with a height of 100 feet or more.
Wheel has changed the world in an extraordinary way. The biggest thing is that wheel has made transportation much easier and faster.

Just like a fully developed athlete, a tiger can climb (although not well), swim, jump long distances and pull a strong human to five times its strength.
Just like lions, tigers, jaguars and elephants, the lion is also a member of the same genus (Panthera). Only these four species of cats can roar.
The roar of the lion is not like the roar of a tiger, but it is similar to the scream of a bound animal.
Olive ridley seabirds prefer to eat small animals. If they can catch them, they will eat monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Most animals that are eaten by olive ridley seabirds are very small.
Scientists believe that ostriches smell the direction of animals and eat them by following the scent.
They can see well at night and can move very stealthily. The otter hunts its prey by stalking it and then pouncing on it.
When a small group of living things (small population) is separated from the main part of the population (like if they come from a mountain range or a river or if they go to a new island so that they can easily move away from it), they often find themselves in a different environment.
Here, there are different resources and competitors, so new populations need to be stronger competitors by adopting different characteristics or changes.
The original population doesn't want any change. They still want to be in the same way.
Time passes and as the new population gets accustomed to the new environment, it also starts ignoring the other population.
Finally, after thousands or millions of years, both settlements will look so different that they will no longer be called the same species.
We call this process of diversification, which means the formation of new species. Diversification is a good step and a very important part of development.
Plants produce oxygen which is used by humans to breathe and they take up carbon dioxide which humans exhale (i.e. exhale).
Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants make food for themselves. It also provides shade.
Plants are the main source of food for us. Without plants, animals cannot live.

Photo formats like 35mm are used the most in the world. It was popular in the late analog film era.
But this is still made, and more importantly, the aspect ratio of the digital camera image sensor is inherited from the digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually a bit misleading, which is 24mm x 36mm in height.
The 3:2 format is known as the pro-rata format because it is the ratio of the sum of the products of the numbers divided by the sum of the products of the numbers.
Common formats (for example, format APS family) have a similar or close to the same orientation ratio.
Very rude and often mocking third rule is a simple directional measure that builds a dynamic image.

At the time of European history, the Catholic Church which was rich and powerful was under scrutiny.
Despite the language and customs differences, Christianity has been a bridge between European countries for thousands of years.
These powers have affected kings to common people.
one of the main Christian doctrines is that money should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and the church's financial fund is specifically for this purpose.
At Rome, the central authority of the church has been around for over a thousand years and it has been concentrated in such a way that many people wondered if it was working or not.
Immediately after the hostilities spread, Britain began a blockade of German seas.
These measures have been effective in cutting off military and civilian supplies, although they have violated international law in the past two centuries.
UK has banned any foreign fishing vessel from entering the entirety of the sea, which has led to a risk to ships moored at the shore.
Because this strategy had received limited response, Germany had also expected a similar response from its unrestricted submarine war.

They kept themselves in solitude, which was for many years, a very bright image of Muhammad's spiritual leanings.
Maize is grown in the north of the mountain range, which is known as the Andes.
Actually, you are alone even if you know the presence of the cave. Once you reach the cave, you are alone.

When these events occurred, the period was generally referred to as the High Middle Ages in Europe, which spans the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300) of European history.
Upper Middle Ages began before the Early Middle Ages and ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a word that encompasses a wide range of ideas, from technological shock or technological imperative to strict meaning that human destiny is scientific laws and technology that are inspired by a hidden logic.
These interpretations of technical determinism usually focus on two general ideas: that technical development has no cultural or political impact and that, therefore, socially appropriate technology is not affected by it and, instead, is "affected" by the society that developed it.
 An example can be given that motor car is essential for the development of roads.
Despite the fact that the road network in the country was only for a handful of cars, the cost of buying a car was reduced by developing new production methods.
The road accidents are caused by the excessive ownership of cars, which has led to the development of new technologies in the field of health care.
Romanticism had a big element of cultural determinism in it, which was taken from Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
Geography has shaped individuals and time has shaped the geography and culture. Society has been shaped by the place and the law has been shaped by the society.
Just as Paris is today considered the fashion capital of the world, so was Constantinople considered the fashion capital of the medieval European world.
With its luxury center status, it was used for about 400 A.D to 1100 A.D.
its position in the 12th century was mainly due to the fact that the warriors brought silk and spices as gifts, which were more valuable than the gifts offered by the Byzantine markets.
At that time, Constantinople was removed from the title of fashion capital and Paris was given the title.
From 10th to 11th century and 14th century, Gothic style was at its peak.
In the beginning, the dress was influenced by Byzantine culture.
However, slow communication channels can lead to a 25-30 year lag in western lifestyles.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe had developed its own style. The religious wars led to the biggest development of the time, people began using buttons to fasten their clothes.
subsistence agriculture is carried out by farmers and their families to meet their basic needs and to produce sufficient food.
Agroecology is a system of farming that uses local, often organic, techniques to maximize crop yields by using the same crop rotation or other relatively easy techniques over time.
Traditionally, most of the farmers have been dependent on subsistence farming and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Indigenous cultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel socially disadvantaged and who are given the opportunity to develop their sense of identity.
The members may vary in age, race, class, place, and/ or sex.
These qualities that separate a sub-culture from the main culture, such as language, beauty, religion, politics, sexuality, geography or a mixture of many factors.
 A subculture's members often signal their membership by using a distinctive and symbolic style, including fashion, manners and dialect.
Common ways of highlighting the importance of socialization include drawing attention to the unfortunate cases of children who grow up to be adults who are not only overlooked but also neglected, unfortunate or abused.
These children are called ‘psycho-trait’ or ‘wild’. Some wild children are kept away from the world by their parents. Some cases are due to mental or physical disabilities of the children.
It is possible that the children were released or escaped from custody because of serious child abuse or trauma.
They were allegedly dragged by others; some are said to have been living in the jungle by themselves.
When transported in a completely inhuman manner, wild children behave in a similar manner (within physical limits) to that of special-treatment animals, such as humans, who are afraid or careless.
While project-based learning should be made easier and more interesting, scafolding goes one step further.
scafolding is not a method of learning, rather it is a tool for people who are learning something new like learning a new computer program or starting a new project.
Spyware can be virtual or real, in other words, teachers are spies but Microsoft Office is a paperclip man.
They are the inner workings of virtual scafold software and they raise questions, signal and provide information that students alone would have to handle.
Children are sent to foster care for many reasons, including neglect, bad treatment, and even extortion.
Children should not grow up in an environment that is not caring, nurturing and educational, but they are growing up.
We consider the Foster Care System as a safe area for these children.
our care system provides safe homes, loving care, stable education and reliable healthcare.
Foster care is for all kinds of needs that are not being met in the home where they are being brought.
Internet, people and interpersonal communication, both elements are brought together.
Internet has different features that can be used and satisfied from a perspective of additional dimensions.

Micro-expressions, facial movements which take a few milliseconds, have been interpreted using video recording.
Especially, it is claimed that one can correctly interpret the subtle expressions of a person to determine whether he is lying or not.
Oliver Sex in his paper President Speech signaled that how people who are mentally impaired and cannot understand speech can still assess honesty.
They also suggest that human behavioural interpretations can be shared with companion animals like dogs.
Recent studies have revealed that there are two pools of genetic diversity: hidden and expressed.
Transformation adds new genetic differences, and selection removes them from the pool of expressed differences.
Displacement and reorientation are different in each generation between the poles.
Suwai, where human-like primates have a digestive system, may have fewer plants available to meet the amino acid needs of the animals.
Additionally, failure to do so could have serious consequences: Depression increases, malnutrition and ultimately death.
Plants are the easiest to obtain resources for proteins, but primates like us have to cook them before we can digest them.
They are easily digestible and provide high amounts of protein with all the essential amino acids.
If our ancestors had solved the "protein problem" in the same way, we should not be surprised like the Chimps do today.
Insomnia is a sleep disturbance that occurs during the normal sleep period and usually resolves within 10-60 minutes.
It can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock which wakes you up without you being fully awake.
If you find yourself resetting the clock in your sleep, put it on the other side of the room so you have to get up to turn it off.
Another option is to drink a lot of fluids (particularly water or tea, a common diuretic) before bedtime, which forces the person to urinate.

By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences were almost broken, and there was one last hope of withdrawal and then joining up with the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were made overnight when the Soviet Union’s Red Army of 800,000 soldiers invaded Poland’s eastern regions and entered the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts. They violated the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-aggression Pact and other bilateral and multilateral both kinds of treaties.
Transportation of goods by ships is a very effective way of bringing large quantities of people and goods from one end of the ocean to the other.
The Navy’s job is to maintain the ability to move people and goods from one place to another and to interfere with the ability of its enemies to move people and goods from one place to another.
The most prominent recent example of this would be the North Atlantic campaign during the Second World War. The US and UK were trying to move troops and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean in order to help each other.
The German Navy was using U-boats to stop the traffic.
But if the Allies had failed, Germany might have defeated Britain because it had the rest of Europe to itself.
It is believed that the goat rearing began in the Zagros Mountains of Iran 10,000 years ago.

England's first steam-powered ships were built in the 16th century.
However, the wagons were usually made of wood and had a uniform bench, but horses could pull them at a faster pace and carry heavier loads on rougher roads.
But gradually, it was realized that if rails were made of iron, they would be more efficient.
But this has become quite common. But iron wheels of wooden vehicles were more efficient than wooden wheels of iron vehicles.
Finally, iron wheels took over wooden wheels in 1767. The first fully ironed railway was launched in 1767.
The first known form of transportation was walking, which humans began to do with the emergence of Homo erectus (meaning the Upper Man) about 20 million years ago.
They were not straight walkers.
About 4.2 million years ago, Australopithecus fossils have been found with two footed walking ability. However, it is possible that Australopithecus could have walked on two feet about 7 million years ago.
We can start being more friendly with the environment by joining an environmental movement and becoming an environmental activist. We can also save the future from some extent of pain by becoming an environmental activist.
This is a symptom treatment like many others. However, if we are not looking for a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problem and make it inactive.
This is very clear that the scientific and technological progress of the world has made a great change in the world and the increase in population and the lifestyle of the human being has caused problems.
The draft was adopted by the Congress on 4th July and was signed by the Chairman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thorn. It was then sent to a block away printing shop run by John Dunlap.

The 25 Dupleps are the oldest surviving copies of the original hand-written document. The original document has not been preserved.
Many biologists still believe that a group of dinosaurs survived extinction and they are still alive today, we call them birds.
They are not regarded as dinosaurs because of their wings and flying ability.
But there are a lot of things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have claws and toes, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like a t Rex.
Nowadays all computers are based on information manipulation and are coded in binary numbers.
Only one of the two values, 0 or 1, can be a binary number, or a bit.
Internal poisoning is not immediately diagnosed. Its symptoms are common like vomiting, so it is not diagnosed immediately.
Internal poisoning is the best symptom of a poisonous household chemical or a drug bottle.
See the label for special instructions for the poison.
Insect biologists use the term ""bug"" to refer to a formal group of insects.
With the most favorable habitat for insects, the definition of old age is based on the similarity of the old age of insects and humans.
Insects like the mole cricket and the mole fly are both nectophagous, meaning they feed on nectar.
MS is the most common neurological disease in the United States, affecting approximately 400,000 people.

Science is the main objective of scientific method to find out the working methods of the world. In fact most of the scientific researches are based on this method.
However, it is not the only one. Experimenting, and experimenting is a kind of testing that is used to end up with one or more possible hypotheses, questions, and observations.
Classical thinkers and philosophers have paid special attention to the classical texts and particularly the Latin writings of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on science are accepted in all branches of science.
As Greek knowledge declined, the West found itself cut off from its own Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Very often, it has been observed that the physical science and behavior of people, often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through the mechanism of biological clocks.
These are the rhythms that are only triggered by external signals and not by internal ones. They are recorded in the brains of all living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
biological clocks are autonomous oscillators that can run free of external cues for a period of time.
Herz and Chess' test was a major suggestion that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used the DNA of a bacterium to insert it into a virus.

When managers start leading their former colleagues, two kinds of behavior emerge. The spectrum has a head on one end that is trying to stay with one of the boys (or girls).
Managers who are different from the rest of the people have problems in making decisions, disciplining people, checking work, assigning responsibilities and making people accountable.
