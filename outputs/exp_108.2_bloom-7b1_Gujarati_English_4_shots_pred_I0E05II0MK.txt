These new environments have different sources and different competitors, so new generations need stronger competitors than they did before, and they need to have different facilities or fit in.
The basic population hasn't changed much, they still need the same kind of fit.
Time goes by, new populations become more and more adapted to their new environment, they become less and less visible.
