This confirms not only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides details which fossils cannot provide, such as colour and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the fur of this animal was on the top dark brown and on the bottom light- or carotenoid-coloured.
The find also gives insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well developed sheath called a quill, but other features of feathers — hooks and barbules — the researchers concluded that the quill must have been an evolutionary development later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or for heart function.
Researchers claimed that this is the tail of a young dinosaur, but the sample showed no feathers of an adult and no juvenile dinosaurs.

After the officials have confirmed the identity of the voter, the voter throws the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.

The candidates may send representatives to witness the whole process. At night, the votes will be counted by volunteers under strict supervision and in accordance with special procedures.

While three people were in the house when the car drove into it, none of them were injured.
The driver was injured, however, in the head.
The road on which the accident took place was temporarily closed while the emergency services were trying to free the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was transferred to Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was subsequently charged with murdering her son.
She is still in detention pending prosecution, but eyewitness statements could be false as a result of widespread publicity.
This is a practice elsewhere in Great Britain, but the Scottish judiciary works differently, and the courts have found that publishing photographs as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee remarks: "Journalists seem to be crossing a dangerous line when they publish photographs and other material of suspects.
The Crown Office, which is responsible for prosecuting, has indicated to journalists that at least until the prosecution has been brought no further comments will be made.
According to a leak, the document refers to the border dispute in which the Palestinians want to redraw the borders in the state of Israel in 1967.
Other issues that are supposedly covered include the future of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel wants a military presence in the Jordan Valley for ten years from the signing of the agreement, the Palestinian Authority wants it for five years.
The guards accompanying the trial to control the plague should be closely supervised by rangers, since the trial has been monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
In the context of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers have been recruited for the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting
Mick O'Flynn, the director of Park Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, said that the four chosen for the first operation were given comprehensive security and training.
Martelly has today appointed a new provisional election commission (CEP) with nine members.
It is his fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a Presidential Commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of the package of measures to steer the country towards new elections.
The Commission was the response to the widespread regime-critical protests that began in October.
The trigger for the sometimes violent protests was the failure to hold elections, of which some are due to be held in 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating have been reported for defective iPods. In total, six fires have been set and four people have suffered minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that it had 27 accidents in connection with the devices.
Last week, the METI announced that it had received 34 additional reports of overheating from Apple, which it described as 'not serious'.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded by describing the delay of the report by Apple as "really regrettable.
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 p.m. local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Office for Disaster Relief in the Northern Marians said that no damage had been reported in the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center had said that there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman has kidnapped tourists from Hong Kong by taking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot with his M16 rifle at tourists.
At least six people have been rescued and there are at least six confirmed deaths.
Six hostages, including the elderly and children, were released, as well as the Filipino photographers.
The photographers took up the space of an elderly lady as she had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot." #
Liggins followed in the footsteps of his father and became a doctor.
He underwent training as a maternity doctor and took up his work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959
While working in the hospital, Liggins began to examine pre-term labor.
His research showed that the application of a hormone accelerated the lung development of the fetus.
Xinhua reported that investigators from the government have recovered two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Ringer colleagues paid tribute to Luna as well.
Tommy Dreamer said: ""Luna was the first queen of extremes. My first manager. Luna died in the night of the two moons. Very unique, exactly like she. A strong woman.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels gave the following comment: "Luna was as crazy as I was... maybe even crazier... I love her and I shall miss her... hopefully she is in a better place.
Of the 1,400 people who were surveyed in the run-up to the federal elections in 2010, 8 percent of those who opposed Australia becoming a republic have risen since 2008.
The temporary acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the election campaign for the federal election this year that she thought Australia would end up as a republic if Queen Elizabeth II was to die.
34 percent of the respondents share this view and want that Elizabeth II is the last Australian monarch.
29 per cent of the respondents said that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 per cent of them said that Australia should never become a republic.
The gold medal winner at the Olympic Games should swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three-layer heats, but because of his many complaints his fitness was doubted.
He was not able to take the necessary medicines to alleviate his pain, as they are banned at the Commonwealth Games.
On 25 January, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Many people confirmed the discovery by different hardware and software at the beginning of February and on Tuesday it was announced.
Cosmic rays may have been a source of water supply for the Earth, together with organic matter which forms proteins and can enable life.
Cosmic comets collided with the Earth long ago, and they promise to give us insights into how planets, in particular the Earth, are formed.
Cuomo (53) took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumours as 'political nonsense' and 'childishness'.
It is speculated that he may be running for the presidency in 2016.
NextGen is a system, which the FAA claims would allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology rather than the older technology based on ground radar to enable the air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
There will be no additional transport facilities established and the underground trains will not stop at Wembley. There are no parking or parking-and-ride facilities available there.
With the fear of transport problems growing, the likelihood grew that the game would be played behind closed doors.
A study published on Thursday in the Science journal reported on the emergence of a new bird species on the Galápagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and at Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new form had developed within just two generations, although it had previously been assumed that this process would take much longer due to the mating between a native Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant Kaktus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into a variety of forms. It can be rolled into tiny pieces.
It can be pulled into a thin cord, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into leaves.
It can be made very thin and glued to another metal. It can be so thin that it sometimes was used to decorate handwritten pictures, called calligraphy, in books called calligraphy books.
This is the pH level of a chemical. You can make a red dye with urine to make a pH indicator.
The ash changes colour depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemicals.
Protons are electrons that have been removed from water molecules (because hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then form them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a protective layer.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had almost every house equipped with a flush toilet, which was connected to a
Remains of sewage systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia and China, there were toilets. In Roman culture, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses that men and women visited in mixed company.
If you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it almost immediately back down.
The satellite was launched by a rocket into space. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and our view.
It is necessary to launch a giant rocket with a height of more than 100 feet to shoot a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in a way that is simply amazing. The greatest service it has given us is much easier and faster transportation.
It has brought us the railway, the car and many other transport means.
In this group are medium-sized cats that eat prey of medium size, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-roaming domestic cats) that eat much smaller prey such as insects, rodents, snakes, lizards
The secret of their success is the niche concept, a special task that every cat has and that ensures that they do not compete with other cats.
Lions are the most sociable cats. They live in large groups, which are called herds.
The herds consist of one to three adult males and up to three females and young.
Women usually have a close relationship with each other, when they live in a large family with sisters and daughters.
The lion packs behave in a similar way to wolf packs and are as deadly to their prey as the wolves are to their prey.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (if not particularly well), swim, long distance jump and with the fivefold strength of a strong man pull.
The tiger is in the same family (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar." #
The roar of the tiger sounds not like the full-throated roar of the lion, but rather like a series of grumbling words.
Ocelot eat small animals. If they can, they steal monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than he is.
Scientists think that otters track animals for food (prey) with their olfactory sense and find them by sniffing where they have been.
They can see in the dark very well and move undetected. Ocelots hunt their prey by matching their environment visually and then attacking their prey.
When a small group of animals (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it comes (for example, when they move over a mountain range or a river or when they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so that the new population needs to have different characteristics or adaptations in order to be a strong competitor than what it used to need.
The original population has not changed at all. It still needs the same adaptations as before.
As time goes by, the new population adapts to their new environment, and then they look less and less like the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, two populations will then look so different that they cannot be classified as the same species.
This process is called specialization, which simply means the emergence of new species. It is an unavoidable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which we breathe, and they take carbon dioxide out of the air, which we exhale (that is, exhale).
Plants produce their food by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses out of plants and make clothing out of plants. We eat mainly plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the biggest predator of his time, so he feared nothing but other Mosasaurs.
His long jaws were equipped with more than 70 sharp teeth, including a second set on the tongue, which meant that there was no escape for any animal that crossed his path.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a hooked tongue. He ate large fish, other Mosasaurs, and maybe even a cannibal.
He took everything in, even a large dinosaur like the T. Rex was not big enough for him.
While most of their food is known to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual meals, including wild boar, peacock, snails and a rodent called the seven-headed snake.
Another difference was that the poor people and women ate their food sitting on chairs. The rich men preferred to hold banquets, where they sat on the side, while they ate their meals.
The Roman courts could not contain food that had come from America or Asia in later centuries.
They had no maize, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Romans ever ate a goat.
The Babylonians built temples to every god they worshipped, and considered them as houses of the god.
Man offered sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to conform to the will of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had a public temple courtyard and then an inner altar courtyard, which was only accessible by priests.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped temples, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The tip of the tower was a special temple dedicated to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East houses did not have such a great significance.
The majority of the Jewish family's life was spent under the open sky.
The women cooked in the yard. Shops were simply open to the street. For the construction of the house, stone was used.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so that wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the old Norse legends, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder. When he travelled further west, he found Greenland and gave it the name Greenland.
But regardless of its discovery, Eskimo people lived there long before that.
Although all the countries were "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the film The Templer's Legacy, you may think that on the back of the Declaration of Independence there was drawn a treasure map.
That is not true, although on the reverse of the document there is written something.
The words 'original declaration of independence, dated on 4 July 1776' were written on the reverse side of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the great scroll (which measures 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up at the beginning of its life to be stored.
It is therefore possible that the addition of the label was simply for labelling purposes.
The landing on D-Day and the subsequent battles liberated the North of France, but the South was still not free.
He was ruled by the 'Vichy' French, who in 1940 signed a peace treaty with the Germans and worked with the occupiers, rather than fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies landed in southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the French liberated the south of France and turned their attention to Germany.
A civilization is a distinct culture shared by a significant number of people who live together and work, a society.
The word 'civilization' comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civil, and civitas, which means city or city-state. It also somehow defines the size of a society.
Cities are the precursors of nations. A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint and a proper dissemination.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognised as genuine civilisations.
While the revolutions fought, the 13 states formed on the basis of the Federal Treaty first formed a weak central government, which consisted of the Congress.
The Congress was not empowered to tax, and there was no national executive or judicial authority, so it relied on the states, which often did not cooperate.
He had no authority to repeal tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles required unanimous consent of all States before they could be changed, and the States took the Central Government so little seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world and was 2006 FIFA World Champions.
Sports that are popular among the general public include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula One motor racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions and Italians take part in international competitions and the Olympic Games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (of which Honshu is the largest), making it the seventh largest island in the world.
Because of the cluster of islands, Japan is often referred to as an archipelago.
The beginning of Taiwan's history dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passed by and recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
The Dutch East India Company founded a Dutch colony in the south west of Taiwan in 1624, which led to a change in the cultivation methods of the indigenous peoples and employed Chinese workers on their rice and sugar plantations." #
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan and declared it in 1885 as a province of the Qing Empire.
The Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War, in which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists mainly of three buildings, namely the Intihuatana, the Sun Temple and the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex were rebuilt to give tourists a better impression of how they looked originally.
In 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu was restored, and the restoration work continues to this day.
For instance, the 35 mm format is the most widely used film format in the world, which corresponds to the end of the film era in the analogue era.
It is still made today, but it is even more important that its image format has been taken over by digital camera sensor formats.
In fact, the 35-mm format is confusingly 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore called 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS format family, for example) have exactly the same or very similar aspect ratio.
The much-maligned and often mocked third rule is a simple directive that creates dynamism and preserves order in a picture.
It states that the intersection of the lines that divide a picture vertically and horizontally is the most effective place for the main motif (see example)." #
In this period of European history, the wealthy and powerful Catholic Church was under scrutiny.
The Christian religion has been the glue that has held together the European states despite the different languages and customs of the people.
His power over everyone, from the king to the ordinary citizen.
One of the most important Christian beliefs is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty.
The central authority of the church was in Rome for more than a thousand years. This concentration of power and money has caused many to doubt whether this principle was adhered to.
In the days after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain initiated a blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective as it cut off the country from life-saving military and civilian supplies, despite this blockade violating the generally accepted international law which was codified in several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain has mined international waters to prevent ships from penetrating whole oceanic regions, which is a danger even for neutral ships.
As the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolation were the dominant attitudes of most citizens and countries.
After the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the nations of Europe wanted to avoid another such situation in the future.
1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the US with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems and a recommendation letter from Charles Batchelor (his previous boss) to Thomas Edison.
The old China had a unique way of showing different eras. Each era in China and each family in power was a separate dynasty.
In the course of the dynasties, there were also unstable periods of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the period of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and the Jin dynasties.
In these times, there were bitter wars among many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The time of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died in the struggle for the highest throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metrical system, a departure from absolutism towards republicanism and nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Also, even after the revolution, all professions were open to all male applicants, so that the most ambitious and best could succeed.
The same applies to the army, because the army rankings now used the calibre as a basis.
The French Revolution inspired many under-privileged people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things that went beyond the everyday life. He often visited a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Nur" (light) to meditate.
The cave itself has survived the times and is a lively picture of Mohammed's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find, even if you know that it exists. Once you are in the cave, you are completely isolated.
There is nothing but the clear sky above and the numerous surrounding mountains from the inside of the cave.
The Cheops Pyramid is the only of the Seven Wonders of the World which still stands.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Cheops Pyramid is one of many great pyramids structures built to honor the dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau or the 'Gizeh Necropolis' in Egypt comprises several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honour of the Pharaoh Cheops and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honour of his wives and family members.
The ‘dressing’ symbol looks like a V and the ‘excision’ symbol looks like a square, with the lower line missing.
Up means that you should start at the top and then move the arrow.
The erasing produces a softer sound, while the erasing is more powerful and expressive.
You may add your own pencil marks; however, the printed lines are there for musical reasons, so they should be respected.
The King of France, terrified by the mob, forced his wife, Marie Antoinette, his two children (Marie-Therese, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old) and his sister, Madame Elisabeth, to return to Paris on 6 October 1789.
They travelled in a carriage back to Paris, surrounded by a mob of people who threatened the king and the queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to open their windows on their carriages.
Sometime a member of the angry mob turned his head in the direction of the corpse of a royal guard killed in Versailles.
The US imperialists’ war expenditures in the Philippines were borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States, to cover the bulk of the expenditures, and the interest on the bonds flowed through the banks of the Wall Street in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the superprofits that emanated from the continued exploitation of the Filipino people were the basic profits of the US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you must understand the context in which the Order was founded.
The period in which the events took place is generally referred to as the Middle Ages, a period in European history that spans the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended in approximately 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technology push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that the human fate is determined by a fundamental logic that is linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
The most common interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas. On the one hand, that the development of technology is a path that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and on the other hand, that technology itself has "effects" on societies that are more intrinsic than socially determined.
You could say that the car is the inevitable by-product of road development.
But a national road network for only a small number of cars is economically unviable. Therefore, new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The widespread ownership of motor vehicles also leads to an increased number of road accidents, which in turn leads to the invention of new technologies in the health sector to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a strong, cultural deterministic element, which was drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography was the geography that molded individuals. Over time, customs and cultures developed with reference to this geography and these, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
So as to be known as the capital of fashion today, Constantinople was the capital of the feudal Europe.
His fame as the epicenter of luxury began about 400 B.C. and lasted until about 1100 A. D.
His status declined in the twelfth century, mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices which were considered to be more valuable than the offerings of the Byzantine markets.
At that time, too, the title of the world's fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic architecture reached its peak between the 10th and 14th centuries.
At the outset, the clothing was strongly influenced by the culture of Byzantium in the east.
Although the styles in the West are 25 to 30 years behind the rest of the world, they are still very much alive and well.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop a distinctive style. One of the most important developments of the time was the fact that people began to use buttons to fasten their clothing.
Needs-based agriculture is agriculture that is aimed at producing enough food to meet the needs of the farmer or farmer's family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often biological cultivation method that uses locally available seeds and combines it with rotational farming or other relatively simple techniques to maximize the yield.
In the past, most farmers practised subsistence farming, and in many developing countries, that is still the case.
Subcultures bring together people who feel neglected by social norms, and enable them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be differentiated by age, ethnicity, class, place and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as such can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual or geographical.
The members of a subculture often signal their membership by a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits and jargon.
One of the most common ways of illustrating the importance of socialization is to rely on the few unfortunate cases of children who have not been socialized by adults because of neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse during their childhood.
Wild children are called ""wild"" or ""wild."" Some wild children have been taken from their parents (usually by people who had taken them in for themselves); in some cases, neglect was the result of the parents' inability to accept the severe intellectual or physical limitations of the child.
Wolf cubs may have suffered severe child abuse or suffered traumatic experiences before escaping or disappearing.
Some have been reared by animals; others have lived alone in the wild.
If it has been raised entirely by wild animals, it will display behaviours (in the context of its physical capabilities) that are almost completely in accordance with those of its specific carer, such as its fear or indifference to people.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the "scaffolding" approach goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but rather a support that helps individuals in a new learning situation, such as when they are using a new computer program or when they start a new project.
Gerüst" can be virtual or real, but also the little office stapler in Microsoft Office.
Virtual assistances are built into the software and are intended to question the steps that the student alone may not be able to complete, suggest alternatives and explain them.
Children are placed in a variety of reasons in foster homes, ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion.
No child should be forced to grow up in a home environment that is not caring, loving and educationally oriented, but many are forced to do so.
For us, the care facility is a piece of security for these children.
Our kinship care system should provide a safe, loving home, caring carers, a stable education and a reliable health care.
The care home should cover all the needs that they had not been able to meet in the home from which they had been removed.
The Internet connects both elements of mass communication, as well as interpersonal communication.
The specific features of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the benefit-and-reward approach.
For example, learning and socialisation are considered important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal engagement and sustained relationships were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied the audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings led to important insights into the interpretation of microexpressions, short-lived facial movements.
In particular, it is claimed that one can identify whether someone is lying by deducing the slightest changes in facial expression.
In his article The President's Speech Oliver Sacks showed how people with a brain injury cannot understand the honesty of people, but still can correctly assess it.
He even claims that the ability to interpret human behaviour may be shared with animals like dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has demonstrated that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation leads to new genetic variations and selection removes these from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with each generation in and out.
Out in the savannah it is very difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of a human to meet his need for amino acids from available plant sources.
In addition, it has serious consequences if you do not take action: growth depression, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been protein in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide large amounts of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
In summary, it should not come as a surprise to us that our own forefathers solved their "protein problem" in the same way as chimpanzees in the savanna today.
Sleep compensation is the process of target-directed waking during the normal sleep periods and the period of short sleep (10-60 minutes) later.
This can be achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without completely waking you up.
If you are someone who imagines the alarm clock in the night, you can put it on the other side of the room so that you have to leave the bed to turn it off.
Another way of doing it is to drink a lot of fluids before going to bed (especially water or tea, which is known for its urinary-tonic effect), so that you have to get up to go to the toilet.
The degree of inner calm that a person has is inversely proportional to the degree of tension in the body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the existing life force. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded to include the path of love of the Mahayana and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (Knowledge energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The centre of Tibetan meditation is the goddess yoga. Through visualising various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are opened and the enlightened consciousness arises.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, which led to a cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war, the collision of systems, the course and the culture led to the countries being at odds.
Two years after the end of the war, the former Allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It should last for the next 40 years and be carried out in the real world by proxy armies on battlefields in Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defence was already completely broken and the only hope was in a retreat and a reorganisation along the Romanian bridgehead.
The plans were however almost obsolete overnight, when over 800,000 Red Army soldiers invaded the white Russian and Ukrainian fronts and created these after they invaded into violation of the Riga agreement, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements into the eastern regions of Poland.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is the most efficient method of transporting large human and goods volumes over the oceans.
The task of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that a country is able to carry people and goods and at the same time to hinder the enemy's ability to do so.
One of the most significant recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans attempted to bring personnel and material to the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, however, the German Navy attempted to stop this traffic mainly with submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Britain exactly as the rest of Europe.
Apparently, goats were domesticated in the Zagros Mountains in Iran around 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and peoples began to keep them as livestock to get easily at their milk, fur, meat and skin.
Sheep were usually kept in herds, wandering on hills or other pasture areas. They were cared for by shepherds, just like the more familiar sheepherders; often, it was children or adolescents. This herding method is still used
In the sixteenth century, England built railways to support its expansion.
While the railway tracks were made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull the wagons at higher speeds and to carry heavier loads than on the rougher roads of the time.
At an early stage, barriers were introduced to ensure the position of the railway. Gradually, however, it became apparent that railways carrying a railway track were more efficient.
This was the customary thing, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron railway tracks were introduced.
The first known means of locomotion was walking. The first human being to walk was Homo erectus (which means "standing man").
Your predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk as regularly as they should have.
Two-footed species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3,9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to help alleviate future suffering a little.
It is in many cases merely a symptomatic treatment. If you are not only temporary solutions, then we should dig to the roots and treat the malady.
It is really obvious that the world has changed due to the scientific and technological progress of mankind and that the problems caused by overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles of people have become more serious.
After its adoption by the Congress on 4 July, a handwritten draft, signed by the Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to the printer John Dunlap.
In the course of the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are known as "Dunlap broadsides" today.
The first public reading of the document took place at the Independence Hall in July.
A copy was sent to George Washington on 6 July, which was read to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy reached London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap broadsheets that are still available are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwriting has not survived the times.
Many paleontologists now believe that there is a group of dinosaurs that have survived and are still alive. We call them birds.
Many people see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But many things about birds look like dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and run on both hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the processing of information in binary form.
A binary number can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these are called binary digits - or bits, to use the computer jargon.
A poisoning can be detected only after a while. The symptoms, for example vomiting, are so general that you cannot immediately make a diagnosis.
The best evidence of a poisoning by ingestion is the presence of an open container of medicines or household chemicals.
Look for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison on the label.
The term 'waste' is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this insect group.
This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs. These insects are very adaptable to parasitizing humans.
Rabies and bedbugs are nidicolous, meaning that they live in their nests or in the homes of their hosts.
In the United States there are about 400 000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which is the most common neurological disease in adults younger and middle-aged.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and the peripheral nerves.
According to research, the risk of developing MS is twice as high for women as for men.
A couple can decide that it is not in their own interest or in the interests of their child to have a baby.
The couples can decide on an adoption plan for their baby.
When a child is adopted, the biological parents give up their parental rights, so that another couple can take on the parental responsibilities.
The main aim of science is to discover how the world works. This is in fact the basis of most scientific investigations.
It is not only about experimentation, but also about the setting of questions and the conducting of observations.
Natural scientists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts and in particular on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all sciences, including psychology, were accepted.
With the loss of Greek language skills, Western Europe was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behaviour are often due to the presence of body-specific rhythms and their production by biological clocks.
A cycle-specific behaviors, which are not only reactions to external cycles, are known in most living beings, even in bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that even in absence of external signals continue to oscillate for a time.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the most significant evidence that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacteria.
They took two experiments, one in which they either labelled the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphor or a protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material concerned, and whether it is a germline cell.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Natur-based tourism draws people who are interested in visiting natural areas, to enjoy the landscape, including the wild plants and animals.
Exemples of activities at the site are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
One example is the visit, photography and studying orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave small provincial towns by car, to their workplace and are passed by other people whose workplace is at the place they just left.
In this dynamic transport system, all are connected to a transport system based on private cars, and support it.
Now, science has pointed out that this massive carbon economy has brought about the breakdown of one of the stable states of the biosphere that has been the human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone takes part in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport systems.
You will rarely hear complaints about the water quality or the collapse of bridges in developed countries.
Why are transport systems so dysfunctional? Why fail them day in and day out? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something fundamentally wrong going on here?
Road traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
It is difficult to study traffic flows because one cannot predict the behaviour of drivers with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, motorists tend to behave in a consistent manner; therefore, traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be represented mathematically in a rough way.
To better represent the flow of traffic, the relationships between the three main characteristics have been defined: (1) river, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the design, construction and operation of facilities on the road.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the sky. Their ability to fly helped them to evade enemies more easily and find more food and mates.
Most insects can fold their wings along their bodies.
They have a wider choice of small underwear, in which they can hide themselves from thieves.
Today, butterflies and moths are the only insects that can't fold their wings.
Many years ago, a man named Aristarch claimed that the sun was at the centre of the movements of the solar system.
Many people thought he was right, but many others believed the opposite: that the solar system including the sun (and even the other stars) revolved around the earth.
It seems to me that this is a sensible thing to do, because it does not seem to me that the earth is moving.
The Amazon River is the second longest and the most water-rich river in the world. It flows more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, with a width of up to six miles.
20 percent of the water that flows over the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon basin main river is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It takes water from thousands of smaller rivers into it.
While the construction of pyramids continued up to the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Gizeh never surpassed their size and technical perfection of construction.
Egyptians in the ancient New Kingdom marvelled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were thousands of years old at the time.
Vatican City has a population of around 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses for its legislation and official communication Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language of most of those who work in the State, while Latin is often used for religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known to mankind for thousands of years, since these can be found in their original form in nature and are easily extracted and processed with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, posited the theory that all things are made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements. It was earth, water, air and fire.
This corresponded more to the four states of aggregation (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma. However, he also posited the theory that they would transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are regarded as metals. Of course there are also other metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
The universe is made up of matter in its entirety. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that billions of them would fit in the point at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was invented by many people as a good friend.
Unfortunately, the pencil has been supplanted by new writing methods, so that it has been pushed back in its status and in its use.
Today, people write news on computer screens, without ever having to get close to a cliff edge.
We have every right to expect that the keyboard will be a lot more interesting when something newer comes along.
The atomic bomb relies on the principle that energy is required to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like if you roll a heavy car up a hill. When the core is split, some of this energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable cores, which means that they will break down even at the slightest provocation.
The surface of the moon consists of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and about 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the Mare and thicker under the highlands.
On the near side, there could be more Maria, as the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Theoretical theories concentrate on finding out what moves people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are acquired through their growing up.
The theories concern what certain people do to want exactly the things they want, and what influences in their environment cause them to want certain things to do or not to do.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two behavioural patterns can emerge when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to "belong to the boys" (or girls) or to remain in the same company.
This kind of manager has problems making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary measures, issuing performance appraisals, assigning responsibilities and enforcing employee responsibilities.
At the other end of the spectrum you become an unrecognizable individual who has to change everything as the team has done and takes everything for itself.
In the end, the manager is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behaviour often leads to friction between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are managed in the same way as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members have for their immediate physical group often the function of a contact point.
You often have greater autonomy than conventional team members, as your teams may meet in different time zones which may not be taken into account by the local leadership.
The presence of a genuine "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, S. 109) is also an unique feature of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the leadership team that reports to each member. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization take the time and effort to introduce an organisational learning concept? A goal for the practical implementation of organisational learning concepts is innovation.
If all available resources are effectively used by all departments of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can arise.
In the end, the joint work of an organisation can lead to a new innovative method of responding to a new customer need.
Before an organisation can be innovative, the leadership must develop a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and learning.
Angel (2006) explains the concept of the continuum as a method to help organisations become more effective.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognitive processes. This limits the research field and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research.
It is well known that various types of brain damage, such as trauma, injuries and tumours, influence behaviour and cause changes in some brain functions.
New technologies are allowing us to see and explore certain brain structures and processes for the first time.
This will give us a lot of information and materials to build simulation models that will help us understand the processes in our heads.
KI is strongly associated with science fiction, but is a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence includes the production of machines for automation of tasks that require intelligent behaviour.
The examples are control, the setting of strategies and timetables, the ability to answer customer questions and queries, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become independent disciplines that are focused on finding real solutions to the problems of the real world.
The artificial intelligence system is used today in many areas of industry, medicine, engineering and military, and is also incorporated into numerous software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of every school. Often a teacher would like to take her pupils to places where a coach journey is not possible.
Virtual excursions are a technical solution. Pupils can view museum objects from their classroom, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art.
Sharing a virtual trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design and build a website every year about their trip to Washington, D.C. The website is updated every year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a collection album.
Blogs can also help improve the writing skills of students. Although students at the beginning of their blog experience often have a sloppy grammar and spelling, this usually changes when there is a readership.
Students are often very critical audiences, so the blogger tries to improve his writing style to avoid criticism.
The blogging forces the students to learn more about the world around them. The need to attract the audience's interest inspires the students to write intelligently and interestingly.
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages pupils to continue learning outside of the traditional school day.
Blogs can help students become more analytical and critical; by responding to Internet material, students can define their own positions in relation to texts by other students and their own perspectives on particular topics.
Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital of Canada and is home to a number of art galleries and museums that present Canada's past and present.
In the south are the Niagara Falls, and in the north the untouched beauty of nature spreads out in Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things and other characteristics make Ontario distinctive from the outside world as being typical of Canada.
A large area further north is sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that many surprises: There are more African Americans in the US than Canadian citizens.
The Indian Ocean islands are situated in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagaskar is by far the largest and, what the animal world is concerned, a separate continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or part of France and are known for their luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam into the country, and in the Comoros and in Mayotte it was very successful.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
The region is bounded by the Sahel zone in the north and the Atlantic Ocean in the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female travellers should declare themselves married, irrespective of their actual marital status.
But wearing a ring is helpful (don't wear a ring that looks too expensive).
Women should recognise that cultural differences can lead to what they regard as an assault, and that it is not uncommon to be beaten, handcuffed, etc.
Keep your principles firm, and don't be afraid to defend them (cultural differences, or not)
The modern Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century, and was used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Merinides as a strategic port with the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed them and rebuilt them under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon them after a major earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan built the city as Dar el Beida again and it was called Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
It is easy to find places in the old Medina where traditional Moroccan goods such as Tagines, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of tinned food are sold, but that is all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the extreme eastern part near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's roads, especially the city centre, underneath." #
While Goma is relatively safe, it is important to plan your stay outside Goma carefully, so that you can learn about the ongoing fighting in North Kivu.
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of the Nyiragongo volcano as well as for some of the cheapest gorilla tracking tours in Africa.
You can use Bodabodas (motorbike taxis) to get around Goma. The usual (local) fare is about FF500 for a short ride.
This in combination with its relative remoteness has made "Timbuktu" a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Owing to its reputation as a tourist attraction and having a airport, Timbuktu is today a poor city.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger because of the threat of sand dunes.
It was one of the most important stops on Louis Gates' PBS special "Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the cities of the country, because it is more of an Arab than an African atmosphere.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the north-east of South Africa. It borders in the east with Mozambique, in the north with Zimbabwe and in the
The park has an area of 19 500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecosystems, each supporting a different animal species.
He is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is regarded as the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As all South African national parks, the park charges daily entry fees.
It may also be worthwhile to buy a wild card that allows access either to selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the namesake of the territory of Hong Kong and is the focus of many tourists.
The buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline are compared to a shimmering bar chart that is visible through the presence of the waters of the Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, you should get off the island and drive towards the opposite shore of Kowloon.
The majority of the city formation of Hong Kong Island is concentrated along the newly acquired land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists have taken over. If you look for traces of colonial past in the area, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forest in the world and extend over 80 km from the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland to the coast.
The Sundarbans were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2005. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is referred to as Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not only mangrove swamps - they also contain some of the last remaining remnants of the mighty jungle that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans stretch over an area of 3 850 square kilometres, of which a third is covered by water and marshes.
The Sundarbans are a nature reserve since 1966 and estimates indicate that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer there.
Buses run all day long from the district-wide bus station (on the other side of the river) and most of the buses, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30 a
Buses are often full and it is advisable to buy a ticket in advance.
Most districts are by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
Taxi collections offer a fast and comfortable way to get to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a curved cable bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 metres high, their length is 378 metres and they have two carriageways with 3,50 m width.
The bridge's clearance is 15 meters. The construction work was completed in August 2011, but the opening of the road was delayed until March 2017.
The bridge should be completed in September 2017. It is expected that the Brazilian customs checkpoints will then be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group that lived in the present-day Paraguayan Oeste. They hunted semi-nomadic, who also farm
The Chaco region was also the home of other indigenous groups, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering
Paraguay, formerly the province of West Indies, was created in the 16th century as a result of the meeting of the Spanish conquistadors with the native
The Spanish began colonization, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for its polo team and its players being among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at Las Cañitas Polo fields.
Small tournaments and competitions can also be watched here at other times of the year.
Informations about polo competitions and ticket sales points can be found at the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is set in accordance with the value of the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged in the only bank in Jersey, which is located opposite the FIC West Store.
The British pound is generally accepted everywhere on the islands and at Stanley credit cards. Also US dollars are often accepted.
On the remote islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, but British and American currency can be accepted; ask the owners in advance about the payment method accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland Islands' currency outside the islands themselves, so you should exchange your money before you leave the islands.
As Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer in the northern hemisphere and winter in the southern hemisphere.
Montevideo is in the tropics. In the summer months, temperatures above +30 °C are common.
The winter can be misleadingly cold: The temperatures rarely go below freezing point, but wind and moisture lead to feeling colder than what the thermometer shows.
There are no distinctive rain or drought periods: The amount of rainfall remains the same over the whole year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to the sight of humans, they are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the instructions of the park authority, visitors should keep at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals.
Even if Bisons, Wapitis, Elches, Bears and virtually all large animals appear to be peaceful, it can still happen that they turn on each other.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not take enough space. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so leave them enough space.
Be aware that odours attract bears and other wild animals. Avoid carrying strong-smelling foods with you or cooking them and keep your storage clean.
Apia is the capital of the island of Upolu and has a population of less than 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 18th century and is the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a shameful stalemate in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships except one British warship were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans died.
While the Mau-Bewegung was organising the independence struggle, a peaceful meeting in the town led to the killing of the chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
In Auckland there are two harbours, so there are many beaches. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Most of them are sandy beaches with safe swimming and most offer shade from the Pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located at the Waitemata Harbour, in the upper-middle-class suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
There are family beaches that are sometimes overcrowded, with a beautiful promenade along the coast. Swimming is safe here.
The most important local beer is ‘Number One’. It is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is ‘Manta’.
There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines are probably better tolerated.
Local tap water is safe to drink, but if you are worried, you will find bottled water.
For Australians, the idea of coffee is "flat white" foreign. A small black is "espresso", cappuccino is high with foam (not with milk) and tea is served without milk." #
Hot chocolate is Belgian standard. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many trips to the reef take place all year round, and injuries caused by any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Although you should follow the advice of authorities, all signs should be observed, and particularly pay attention to safety warnings.
Shrimps are often seen in the vicinity of beaches and in the vicinity of river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can also occasionally be seen outside
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and would flee.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live in the sea, their primary habitat is in river mouths north of Rockhampton.
A reservation in advance gives the traveller the assurance that he will have a place to stay after his arrival at the destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although you may also book other accommodation forms, such as tent sites, through a travel agency.
Travel agents usually offer packages in which breakfast, transport to and from the airport or even a combination of flight and hotel are included.
You can also hold your reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain further documents for your destination (for example, a visa).
Any changes or requests should be made first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
In some festivals, the vast majority of festivalgoers decide to camp on site, and most visitors feel that this is an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you have to get there early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that there will be music playing on some parts of the festival until late at night, even if the music has stopped on the main stages.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic in winter, check the state of the cabin, as breaking through ice can cause quite a disturbing noise for the most affected.
Cruise ships also offer time for a stay in St. Petersburg. Passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos usually try very hard to keep their guests for as long as possible and to spend as much money as possible. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits are sometimes difficult to find.
You usually have a special offer of food, drinks and entertainment to keep the guests entertained and ensure that they stay.
Some casinos offer alcoholic beverages free of charge. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good players know how important it is to remain sober." #
Anyone who wants to drive over high mountains or over passes should be prepared for snow, ice and temperatures below freezing.
On icy and snowy roads, the liability is low and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
In a snowstorm, it is possible to fall so much snow that you can get stuck.
The visibility can also be affected by falling or drifting snow or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, in many countries the weather is cold and snowy all the year round, and the traffic is running all the year round almost continuously.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari refers to a typical travel to observe the overwhelming African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, are prone to approaching cars close to them, and the standard equipment enables a good view.
Lions, bears and leopards are often timid and you can observe them better with a telescope.
A bushwalk (also known as a "bushwalk", "walking safari" or "footing") typically consists of a walking trip which can last for several hours or several days
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held at other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Olympic Summer Games after it hosted the Summer Olympics in 1964.
If you have already booked your flights and accommodation for 2020, before the rescheduling announcement was made, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
The cancellation policies vary, but most of them did not apply until the end of March, for the Olympics that were planned for that year.
It is estimated that most tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, a typical ticket will cost ¥7,000.
Brushing wet clothes can help drying. Many hotels provide irons and ironing boards, even if you are not present in the room.
If no iron is available or you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer if one is available.
Be careful that the fabric does not get too hot (it can shrink it or lead to burns).
To clean water there are various methods. Some of them are more effective than others to prevent certain dangers.
In some areas, it is enough to boil water for one minute, whereas in others, it must be several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies greatly, and if you have any doubts, then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter animal pests which they do not know from their home regions.
Infestation may destroy food, cause irritation or even cause allergic reactions, poison or transmit disease.
Infections as such or dangerous animals which can cause injury or death to humans are usually not classified as vermin.
Free trade is the ability to purchase goods that are exempt from duties and taxes at certain places.
Travellers whose destination country has a high taxation rate can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, in particular on alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmount on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway is the most challenging driving section, as it often leads through remote, undeveloped terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: steep gradients, narrow roads and sharp turns are more prevalent here.
The speed limits given in the preceding and following sections are noticeably lower than in the previous and following sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict compliance with them is even more
But interestingly, the mobile coverage is much better than in many other areas of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German bread is quite tasty. In Bavaria, it is quite rich and varied, as well as in Austria.
Bread is widely available, with apples being boiled all year round and pears and plums being used in summer.
Many German cakes also contain nuts, almonds or other nuts. Popular cakes often fit particularly well to a strong cup of coffee.
If you wish to produce small, but rich baked goods, then try this, which is known in different regions as Berliner, pancakes or crêpes.
A curry is a dish that is based on herbs and spices, with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either dry or wet depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is used in curries; in South India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is used." #
Indonesian cuisine is a catch-all term that encompasses a great variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
When the term is used without any further attributes, it refers to the food that originated in the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine, which is now widely spread throughout the island group, offers a range of simple spiced dishes. As flavouring agents they prefer nuts, chillies, sugar (especially javanese coconut sugar) and a range of aromatic spices.
Stitching is a means of supporting the feet of the riders on both sides of the saddle.
You give the rider more stability, but there are security concerns because the feet of the rider may get caught in them.
If a rider falls off the horse and hooks his foot on the stirrup, he can be pulled along if the horse passes.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, narrow sole.
In addition, some saddles, in particular English saddles, have safety buckles which allow the saddle to fall off when it is pulled off by a falling rider from behind.
The Cochamó Valley - Chile's most important climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a number of large granite walls and -cliffs.
The summits offer a breathtaking view. Climbers from all over the world discover new routes along the walls, which offer endless opportunities.
Departure sports such as skiing and snowboarding are popular sports, in which skis or a snowboard are attached to your feet and you descend a slope over a snow covered surface.
Skiing is a popular holiday activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as'ski-penners', who plan their entire holiday around skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - there are cave paintings depicting skiers dating back to 5000 BC!
The origins of skiing as a sport go back at least to the 17th century and in 1861 the first ski club in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Backpacking with a backpack: This activity is also known as skitouring or ski walking.
It resembles alpine skiing or mountaineering, but it does not have to be, because these activities are carried out in steep terrain and require much stiffer skis and boots
Take the ski route as a comparable hiking route.
In good circumstances you can cover a greater distance on foot than on skis – only very rarely will you reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy pack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has a number of independent countries. Normally, you would have to apply for multiple visas and go through multiple passport controls if you want to travel through several countries.
The Schengen area works in this respect, however, somewhat like a country.
So long as you remain within this zone, you can usually cross the border without having to go through the passport control again.
In accordance with this, you do not have to apply for a Schengen visa for each of the Schengen member states individually, which saves time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique. Some tax authorities define over 100 years old goods as antiquities.
The definition indicates geographical deviations where the age limit may be lower in North America than in Europe.
Handmade products could be referred to as ‘antique’, although they are younger than similar products produced in mass production.
The reindeer herding is a major source of livelihood for the Sámi, and the culture around the trade is also important for many who work in other occupations.
Also, in the past, not all Sámi bred reindeer in large numbers, but they lived mainly from fishing, hunting and similar activities.
Today, many Sámi work in modern jobs. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
In addition, the term 'Gypsies' is often used by non-Roma as a pejorative term, since it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma.
If you are visiting a country that has issued a travel warning, your travel insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also consult the advice of other governments as your own. Their advice is however aimed at their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may be confronted with other situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Conferences are only a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views expressed are often superficial, general and in comparison to the more detailed information that can be found elsewhere, are too simplistic.
Weather is the umbrella term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, social disruption or loss of life.
Floods can occur anywhere in the world and there are different types of them, which depend on the geography, topography and the atmospheric conditions
Strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall and forest fires are forms and effects of thunderstorms, tornadoes, waves and hur
Regional and seasonal weather phenomena such as blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms are some of the examples.
Travellers are strongly advised to be on the lookout for any type of weather that affects their area, as this could have a negative impact on all travel
Anyone planning to travel to a country which is a war zone should have a professional training for that.
A search for ""course on hostile environments"" will probably show the address of a local firm.
A course covers all the issues discussed here in a much more detailed way, usually combined with practical experience.
A course usually lasts for two to five days and includes role-playing, lots of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
There are many books and journals on survival in the wilderness, but few publications on war zones.
Travellers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure that they have valid travel documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with a non-specified gender (X) or documents that have been updated to reflect the desired name and gender, is different.
The readiness of foreign governments to recognise these documents is expressed in quite different ways.
The searches at security checks have become more intrusive in the wake of 11 September 2001.
Transgender people should not expect that their privacy and dignity will be protected when passing through the scanners.
Riss-currents are the return flow of broken waves, often at breakers or similar.
Because of the underwater topology, the return flow concentrates in a few deeper areas and a rapid current can form there.
The majority of deaths are due to fatigue trying to swim against the current, which is impossible.
When you get out of the current, it is not difficult to get back in.
You should try to get somewhere where you are not caught again. Alternatively, you should try to get somewhere where you are not noticed, perhaps waiting for rescue.
The shock of return is earlier than the shock of culture (the honeymoon phase is not as pronounced), lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travellers who found it easy to adapt to the new culture find it difficult to adapt to their own culture.
When you return home after a long-term stay abroad, you have adapted to a different culture and have abandoned some of the behaviours of your home culture.
When you first travelled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding because they knew that travellers had to adapt to a new country.
Maybe it is not expected that returning travellers should be patient and understanding.
The sound and light show at the Pyramids is one of the most interesting attractions for children in the area.
You can see the Pyramids in the dark and while it is still quiet, before the show begins.
Every day you hear the sounds of tourists and vendors. The history of sound and light is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is used as a background and narrator of a long history.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids, and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The Southern Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most stations. In 2020, there were sixteen active stations.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
More islands are Livingston Island and Deception, where the overflowing caldera of an active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbour.
Elsworthland is the region south of the Bellingshausen Sea, which is the boundary of the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the Halbinsel go here into the plateau and rise again to form the 360 km long chain of Ellsworth mountains, which is split by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains of the Antarctic, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak is the Mount Vinson, at 4892 m.
In remote areas without mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a substitute for a mobile phone, since you have to be in clear sight of a satellite to make a call.
The service is often used by ships, including pleasure ships, and expeditions that require data and voice telecommunications.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you further information about the connection to that service.
An ever more popular option for people planning to take a year off is study and training abroad.
This is particularly popular among graduates, since it enables them to take a year off before university without affecting their studies.
In many cases, participation in an exchange programme can actually improve your chances of getting a university degree in your home country.
In general, a fee is levied for registration to these training programmes.
Finland is a great destination for boat tours. The "land of the thousand lakes" has thousands of islands - in the lakes and in the archipelagoes.
For the archipelagos and seas, you do not necessarily need a boat.
Although the coastal island groups and the largest lakes are actually big enough for every boat, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is the national leisure activity in Finland, one in six or eight owns a boat.
This is not comparable to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, one to fourty.)
The majority of pure Baltic cruises include a longer stay in St Petersburg in Russia.
That means that you can visit the historical city for several whole days while you are back at home and stay on the ship overnight.
If you only go on a tour of the countryside, you do not need a separate visa (Stand 2009).
Some cruises offer Berlin as a destination in Germany. You can see on the map above that Berlin is far from the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and from all walks of life, especially if they have never flown or have had a traumatic experience behind them.
That is not shameful: it is nothing but the personal anxieties and antipathies which many people have.
More about the workings of aircraft and the processes during a flight can help some to overcome their fear of the unknown or the feeling of being powerless.
Courier companies are paid well for the speedy delivery of things. Often, the time factor is a very important factor in corporate documents, trade goods or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the larger companies use their own aircraft, but on other routes and on smaller companies, difficulties arose.
If they sent things via air freight, the loading and customs clearance could take several days on some routes.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as unaccompanied baggage. The airlines' rules do not allow passengers to send luggage without a passenger.
The obvious way to fly in first or business class is to pay a hefty sum to get the privilege.
That is, however, not cheap: As a rough guide, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business and the double fare for first class.
Generally, it is pointless to look for discounts on direct flights from A to B, even if you are looking for business or first class seats.
The airlines know very well that there is a certain core group of fliers who are prepared to pay a lot of money to be able to get to their destination quickly and easily and demand appropriate prices.
The capital of Moldova is Kishinev. The native language is Romanian, but many people speak also Russian.
Moldavia is a multiethnic republic, which has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
This conflict in 1994 led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognised by any UN member state.
While the political negotiations failed, the economic relations between these two parts of the Republic of Moldova were restored.
The most important religion in Moldova is the Christian-Orthodox.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest harbour after Istanbul and a very good transport hub.
The once ancient city of Smyrna is today a modern, progressive and busy business centre, located on a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass buildings and modern shopping centres are shaped by classic red tiled roofs, the market from the eighteenth century, as well as old mosques and churches, although the city is more characterised by a Mediterranean atmosphere than that of traditional Turkey.
The village Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
On the cemetery there are some interesting marble sculptures of birds.
It's worth a half hour to wander through the fascinating village.
In the north and close to it is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which has been known to foreigners after Lord Byron described its beauty in vivid colours.
The Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly from Cabo da Roca to Sintra.
Visit also in the North the great shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (Pilgrimage site) – a place which is world famous for its Marian apparitions.
Please think of it as a mass grave and as a place of immense significance for a substantial part of the world's population.
Many still live, and many more have survived, and many more with relatives who were killed or worked to death, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat this place with the dignity, respect and reverence it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not vandalise the site by painting or scratching it.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer Catalan, the majority understand it, and almost everyone can speak Spanish.
Most of the signs are however only in Catalan, as it is laid down as the first official language.
Although Spanish is also widely spoken in public transport and other institutions.
Normal announcements are made in the Metro only in Catalan, but unforeseen disturbances are reported by an automatic system in a variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are said to be arrogant.

The rough exterior of Paris disappears very quickly if you take basic manners into account.
The Plitwitzer Seen National Park is heavily forested, with mainly coniferous and deciduous trees and a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
He has a remarkable diversity of microclimates, of soils, of different altitudes, and of plant communities.
The area is also home to a very large variety of animal and bird species.
There are rare fauna like European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, foxes, wild cats and hens, as well as many more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts that reach to the knees, and they must cover their shoulders.
In most monasteries there are no diapers for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one in bright colours, the monk or nun will smile at you at the gate.
By analogy, men should wear trousers that reach below the knees.
And these can be borrowed from the stockroom, but the clothes are not washed for each user, so you may not feel comfortable in these shirts." For men there is a uniform size!
The cuisine of Mallorca is based, as in similar areas of the Mediterranean, on bread, vegetables and meat (particularly pork) and uses olive oil.
A simple, popular evening meal, especially in the summer, is the Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any available ingredient such as cheese, tuna etc.
All nouns begin beside the word 'you' for 'you' always with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is a very important way of distinguishing between some verbs and objects.
It makes reading easier, but writing is a little bit difficult because you have to decide whether a verb or a noun is used as the main word.
The Italian pronunciation is relatively simple, since most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to be aware of are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the vowel following them.

This would help you to learn more about the Persian language and to understand better the formulations.
If you speak a Romance language, it is easier to learn Portuguese.
People who speak Spanish might be quick to conclude that Portuguese is so similar that it is not necessary to learn it.
Ancient observatories are no longer in operation and are now museums or educational institutions.
As the light pollution during its peak was not the problem it is today, they are usually found in cities or on university grounds that are easier to reach than those built in the last few years.
Most modern research telescopes are colossal structures in remote areas with favourable atmospheric conditions.
Seeing the cherry blossoms, known as hanami, is a part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept originates from China, where plum blossoms are the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first Cherry Blossom Festivals were held by the Emperor for himself and other members of the Imperial Court.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove just one.
If you visit a formally laid out garden and collect samples, you will also be kicked out without discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to live in, and once you've arrived you can almost buy anything.
As you are located in the extreme tropical regions and only a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with both heat (always) and strong sun (rarely) as well as with strong winds." #
There are also a few buses that go northwards to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives
Make sure that the bus you want to take is going to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kirjat Arba.
Inland waterways could provide a very useful basis for holiday planning.
For example, visits to castles in the Loire Valley, in the Rhine Valley or a cruise along the Erie Canal.
They also present popular cycling and walking routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is regarded as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with the festival were adopted by non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries as well.
There is a tradition to spend the night of Easter in an open place to see the sunrise.
There are certainly Christian-theological explanations for this tradition, but it could also be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
Traditional churches often hold a midnight vigil on Saturday night, during the Easter weekend, when the celebrations of the congregations often begin at midnight, when the resurrection of Christ is celebrated.
All animals that came to the islands originally came either by swimming, flying or by being swept here.
Because of the great distance from the continent, mammals were not able to undertake the journey, which made the giant tortoise the main grazing animal on the Galapagos Islands." #
Before the first humans set foot on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals were introduced, including goats, horses, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise over the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky is usually dark around the clock.
The sparsely populated areas and the light pollution are not a problem, so you can enjoy the starry sky.
The Japanese work culture is hierarchical and formal than what Westerners might be used to.
Coats are a commonplace business attire and colleagues address themselves by their family names or by their occupational titles.
The harmony at work is of such vital importance, with the focus being on the group rather than on individual achievements.
Often, employees have to ask for the approval of their superiors for all decisions they take and it is expected of them that they will comply with the instructions of their bosses without question.
