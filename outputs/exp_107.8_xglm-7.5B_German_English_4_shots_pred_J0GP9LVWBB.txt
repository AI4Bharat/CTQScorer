This confirms not only that some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides details that fossils in general cannot provide, such as colour and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the fur of this animal was on the top brown and on the bottom light- or carotenoid-coloured.
The find also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well developed sheath called the quill, but other features of feathers – hooks and barbules – the researchers concluded that the quill must have been an evolutionarily later development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or for heart function.
Researchers claimed that this is the tail of a young dinosaur, but the sample showed no feathers and no dinosaur tails.

In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and insert a pre-printed sheet of paper into a sealed envelope.
After the officials have confirmed the identity of the voter, the voter throws the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.

Candidates may send representatives to attend to every stage of the process as witnesses. At night, the votes will be counted by volunteers under strict supervision and on special procedures.

The road on which the accident took place was temporarily closed while the rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was transferred to Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was charged with murdering her son in the meantime.
She is still in detention awaiting trial, but eyewitness statements could be false as a result of widespread publicity.
This is the practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but the Scottish judiciary works differently, and the courts have found the publication of photographs as potentially harmful.
Professorin Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee remarks: "Journalists seem to cross a dangerous line when they publish photographs etc. of suspects.
The Crown Office, which is responsible for prosecuting, has hinted to journalists that at least until the prosecution no further comments will be given.
According to a leak, the document refers to the border dispute in which the Palestinians demand a reversal of the borders in the state of 1967.
Other issues, which are supposedly covered, include the future of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel wants a military presence in the Jordan Valley for ten years from the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority is willing to accept only five years.
The guards accompanying the trial to control the plague should be closely supervised by rangers, since the trial has been monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
In the context of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited for the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting programme
Mick O'Flynn, the director of Park Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, said that the four selected hunters had received comprehensive security and training training.
Martelly has today appointed a new provisional election commission (CEP) with nine members.
It is his fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of the package of measures to steer the country towards elections.
The Commission was the response to the widespread regime-critical protests that began in October.
The trigger for the sometimes violent protests was the fact that elections had not been carried out, of which some are due in 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating have been reported for faulty iPods. In total, six fires were started and four people suffered minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that it had 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week METI announced that it had received 34 additional reports of overheating from Apple which it described as "not serious
The Ministry responded by saying that it was really regrettable that Apple had moved the report by the end of the year.
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday.")
The Office of Disaster Management in the Northern Mariana Islands said that no damage had been reported in the country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center had declared that there were no indications of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman has kidnapped tourists from Hong Kong by taking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot with his M16 rifle at the tourists.
At least six confirmed dead have been rescued and there are currently at least six confirmed deaths.
Six hostages, including the elderly and children, were released, as well as the Filipino photographers, early on.
The photographers took up the space of an elderly lady as she had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot." #
Liggins followed in the footsteps of his father and became a medical doctor.
He went on to become a midwife and took up his post at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working in the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature contractions.
His research showed that the application of a hormone accelerated the lung maturation of the fetus.
Xinhua reported that investigators from the government had recovered two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Ringer-colleagues also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: ""Luna was the first queen of extremes. My first manager. Luna died in the night of the two moons. Very unique, exactly like she. A strong woman.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels gave the following comment: "Luna was just as crazy as I was... maybe even crazier... I love her and I will miss her... hopefully she is in a better place.
Of the 1,400 people who were interviewed in the run-up to the Federal Elections in 2010, 8 percent of those who opposed Australia becoming a republic have risen since 2008.
The temporary acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard declared during the election campaign for the federal election 2010, that she believed Australia would end its reign of Queen Elizabeth II as a republic.
34 percent of those surveyed share this view and want that Elizabeth II is the last Australian monarch.
29 per cent of the respondents said that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 per cent of the respondents said that Australia should never become a republic.
The gold medal winner at the Olympic Games should swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three-layer heats in the swimming events at the Commonwealth Games, but his many complaints were doubted.
He was not able to take the necessary medication to alleviate his pain, as they are banned at the Commonwealth Games.
On 25 January, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer scientist at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Many people confirmed the discovery via different hardware and software at the beginning of February and on Tuesday it was announced.
Cosmic rays may have been a source of water supply for the Earth, together with organic matter that forms proteins and can enable life.
Cosmic collisions with comets have given scientists a glimpse into how planets, in particular Earth, form.
Cuomo (53) took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He described the rumours as 'political nonsense'.
It is speculated that he may be seeking the presidency of the Council in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of the older technology based on ground radar, to enable the air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
There will be no additional transport facilities established and the underground trains will not stop in Wembley. There are no parking facilities or parking-and-ride facilities available at the site.
With the fear of transport problems growing, the likelihood that the game would be played without the fans of the team behind closed doors grew.
A study published on Thursday in the Science journal reported the emergence of a new bird species on the Galápagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and at Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species has developed within just two generations, despite the fact that it was previously thought to take much longer.
Gold can be processed into a variety of forms. It can be rolled into tiny balls.
It can be drawn into a thin thread which can be twisted and woven. It can be hammered or rolled into leaves.
It can be made very thin and glued to another metal. It can be so thin that it sometimes was used to decorate handwritten pictures, called pictures, called pictures handwritten.
This is the pH value of a chemical. You can make a red dye with it.
The ash changes colour depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemicals.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been removed from their electrons (because hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an
Mix the two powders together and then form them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a protective layer.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had almost every house equipped with a flush toilet, which was connected to a
Remains of wastewater systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia and China there were toilets. In Roman culture toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses that men and women visited in mixed company.
If you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back down almost immediately.
The satellite was launched by a rocket into space. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and our view.
It is necessary to launch a giant rocket with a height of more than 100 feet to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in a way that is simply amazing. The greatest service it has given us is the simplest and quickest mode of transport.
It has brought us the railway, the car and many other means of transport.
In this category are medium-sized cats that eat prey of medium size, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-roaming domestic cats) that eat much smaller prey such as insects, rodents, snakes and birds." #
The secret of their success is the niche concept, a special task that every cat has and that ensures that they do not compete with other cats.
Lions are the most social cats. They live in large groups, which are called 'herds'.
The herds are composed of one to three adult males, and up to thirty females and young.
Women usually have a close relationship with each other, if they live in a large family with sisters and daughters.
Lions are similar to wolves and dogs in their behaviour, and are equally dangerous to their prey.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (although not particularly well), swim, long distance jump and with the fivefold power of a strong man pull.
The tiger is in the same family (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar." #
The roar of the tiger does not sound like the loud roar of the lion, but rather like a sentence of snarling words.
Ocelot eat small animals. If they can, they steal monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than he is.
Scientists think that otters track animals for food (prey) with their olfactory sense and find them by sniffing where they have been.
They can see in the dark very well and move undetected. Ocelots hunt their prey by matching their environment visually and then attacking it.
When a small group of animals (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it comes (for example, when they move over a mountain range or a river or when they move to a new island, so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so that the new population needs different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor than what it used to need.
The original population has not changed at all. It still needs the same adaptations as before.
As time goes by, the new population adapts to their new environment, and then they look less and less like the other population.
After tens of thousands or even millions of years, two populations will then look so different that they will no longer be classified as belonging to the same species.
This process is called specialization, and that simply means the emergence of new species. It is an unavoidable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that we breathe, and they take carbon dioxide that we exhale (that is, exhale).
Plants produce their food by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses out of plants and make clothing out of plants. We eat mainly out of plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the biggest predator of its time, so he feared nothing but other Mosasaurs.
His long jaws were equipped with more than 70 sharp teeth, including a second set on the tongue, which meant that there was no escape for any animal that crossed his path.
We do not know for sure, but he may have had a big mouth. He ate fish, large fish, other Mosasaurs and perhaps even a cannibal.
He took everything into his hands, even a big dinosaur like the T. Rex was not big enough for him.
We should be aware that the majority of their food would be familiar to us, but the Romans had their own share of strange or unusual meals, including wild boar, peacock, snails and a kind of insect called the seven-legged frog.
Another difference was that the poor people and women ate their food sitting on chairs. The rich men preferred to hold banquets where they sat on the side, while they ate their meals.
Courts of ancient Rome could not contain foodstuffs that came from America or Asia in later centuries.
They had no wheat, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no Romans ever ate a goat.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a temple which was regarded as the house of the god.
Man offered sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to conform to the will of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner altar room, which only priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped temples were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses did not have such a great significance.
The majority of the Jewish family's life was spent under the open sky.
The women cooked in the house. Businesses were simple: open shop windows. For the house construction, stone was used.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so that wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the old Norse legends, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder. When he travelled further west, he found Greenland and gave it the name Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo people lived there already at that time.
Although all the countries were "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the film The Templer's Legacy, you may think that on the back of the Declaration of Independence there was drawn a treasure map.
That is not true, nor is it written down anywhere - quite the reverse.
The words 'original declaration of independence, dated July 4, 1776' were written on the reverse side of the document.
Whether or not it was written by someone, it is known that the great scroll (which measures 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up at the beginning of its life to be stored.
It is therefore possible that the labelling was added simply as a label.
The landing on D-Day and the subsequent battles freed Northern France, but the south was still not free.
He was ruled by the 'Vichy' French, who in 1940 signed a peace treaty with the Germans and worked with the occupiers, rather than fighting them.
The Allies landed in southern France on 15 August 1940; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the French liberated the south of France and turned their attention to Germany.
A civilisation is a distinctive culture shared by a significant number of people who live together and work, a society.
The word civilisation comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state and that also somehow defines the size of a society.
Cities are the forerunners of nations. A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint and an appropriate dissemination.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving any significant historical evidence behind and failing to be recognised as genuine civilisations.
While the revolutionaries were fighting for their independence, the 13 states formed on the basis of the Federal Treaty first formed a weak central government, which consisted of the Congress.
The Congress was not empowered to levy taxes, and there was no national executive or judicial authority, so it relied on the agencies of the states, which often did not cooperate.
He had no authority to abolish taxes and duties between States.
The articles required unanimous agreement of all Member States before they could be changed, and the States took the Central Government so little seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world and was the 2006 FIFA World Champions.
Famous sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula One motor racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions and Italians take part in international competitions and Olympic Games.
Japan has nearly 7000 islands (of which Honshu is the largest), making it the seventh largest island in the world.
Because of the cluster of islands, Japan is often referred to as an archipelago.
The beginning of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passed by and recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
In 1624 the Dutch East India Company establishes a trading post in the south west of Taiwan, which initiates a change in the cultivation methods of the indigenous peoples and employs Chinese labourers on their rice and sugar plantations
In 1683, Chinese forces took control of the western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan and declared it in 1885 a province of the Qing dynasty.
The Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, after the defeat in the First Chinese-Japanese War, in which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists mainly of three buildings, namely the Intihuatana, the Sun Temple and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex were rebuilt to show tourists how they looked originally.
By 1976, three-quarters of Machu Picchu was restored, and the restoration work continues to this day.
For instance, 35 mm is the most widely used film format worldwide, which corresponds to the end of the film era in the analogue era.
It is still being produced today, but it is even more important that its image format has been taken over by digital camera sensor formats.
In fact, the 35-mm-format is confusingly 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore referred to as 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS format family, for example) have exactly the same or very similar aspect ratio.
The much-maligned and often mocked third-rail rule is a simple directive that creates dynamism and at the same time preserves order in a picture.
It states that the intersection of the lines that divide a picture vertically and horizontally is the most effective place for the main motif (see example)." #
In this period of European history, the wealthy and powerful Catholic Church was under scrutiny.
Since more than a thousand years, Christianity has kept the European states united despite different languages and customs.
His omnipotence ruled over everyone, from the king to the ordinary citizen.
One of the most important Christian beliefs is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that it is the money of the churches that are there for this reason.
The central authority of the church was in Rome for more than a thousand years. This concentration of power and money led many to doubt whether this principle was adhered to.
A few days after the outbreak of fighting in the region, Britain initiated a blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective, as it cut off the country from life-saving military and civilian supplies, despite this blockade contravened the generally recognised principles of international law, which had been codified in several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain contaminated international waters to prevent ships from penetrating whole oceanic areas, which was a threat to neutral ships as well.
The response to this tactic was limited, and Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolation were the dominant attitudes of most citizens and countries.
After the horrors of the First World War, the nations of Europe wanted to avoid another such situation in the future.
1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems and a recommendation letter from Charles Batchelor (his previous employer) to Thomas Edison.
The old China had a unique method of displaying different periods of time. Each period in China and each family in power was a separate dynasty.
In the course of the dynastic periods there were also unstable periods of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the period of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and the Jin Dynasties.
In these times, there were bitter wars among many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The time of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died in the struggle for the highest throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metrical system, a retreat from absolutism towards republicanism and nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Also, all professions were open to all male applicants, so that the most ambitious and best could succeed.
The same applies to the military, since the ranks were based on the caliber rather than on the class.
The French Revolution inspired many oppressed people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very much interested in things that went beyond the everyday life. He often visited a cave called Hira, which was known as the cave of 'Nur' (light) on the mountain of 'Nur' (
The cave itself has survived the times and offers a lively picture of Mohammed's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find even if you know that it exists. Once you are in the cave, you are completely isolated.
There is nothing but the clear sky above and the numerous surrounding mountains from within the cave.
The Cheops Pyramid is the only of the Seven Wonders of the World which still stands.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Cheops Pyramid is one of many great pyramid structures built to honor the dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau or the 'Gizeh Necropolis' in Egypt's Valley of the Dead comprises several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honour of the Pharaoh Cheops and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honour of his wives and family members.
The ‘dressing’ symbol looks like a V and the ‘excision’ symbol looks like a square, with the lower line missing.
Up means that you start at the top and should be moving the arrow.
The erasing produces a softer sound, while the erasing is more powerful and expressive.
You are free to add your own pencil marks; however, I would remind you that the printed lines are there for musical reasons, so they should be respected.
The King of France, Marie-Antoinette, her two small children (Marie-Therese, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old) and the sister of the King, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris by a mob of market women on 6 October 1789.
They travelled in a carriage back to Paris, surrounded by a mob of people who threatened the king and the queen with threats.
The mob forced the king and queen to open their windows of their carriages.
Sometime later a member of the mob turned his head in the direction of a royal guard killed in Versailles.
The US imperialists’ war expenditures in the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the U. S. to cover the bulk of the expenditures, and the interest on the bonds flowed through the banks of Wall Street in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the superprofits of the continuous exploitation of the Filipino people came from the profits of the US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context in which they were founded.
The period in which the events took place is generally referred to as the Middle Ages, a period in European history that spans the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended in approximately 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technology push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that the human fate is determined by a fundamental logic which is linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
The most common interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas. On the one hand, that the development of technology is a process that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and on the other hand, that technology itself has "effects" on societies that are more intrinsic than socially determined.
It is possible to say that the motor vehicle is a necessary precondition for the development of roads.
But a national road network for only a small number of cars is economically unsustainable. Therefore, new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The widespread ownership of motor vehicles also leads to an increased number of road accidents, which in turn leads to the invention of new technologies in the health sector to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a strong, cultural deterministic element, which was drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography is the geography that formed individuals. Over time, customs and cultures developed with reference to this geography and these, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
So as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so Constantinople was the fashion capital of the feudal Europe.
His fame as the epicentre of luxury began about 400 BC and lasted until about 1100 AD.
His status declined in the twelfth century, mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices which were considered more valuable than the offerings of the Byzantine markets.
At that time, too, the title of the world's fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries.
At the outset, the clothing was strongly influenced by the culture of Byzantium in the east.
However, the styles in the West are 25-30 years behind the rest of the world.
In the Middle Ages Western Europe began to develop a distinctive style. One of the most important developments of the time was the use of buttons to fasten clothing.
Needs-based agriculture is agriculture that is aimed at producing as many food products as possible to meet the needs of the farmer or the farmer's family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often biological cultivation method that uses surplus, locally grown seed and combines it with rotational farming or other relatively simple techniques to maximise yield.
In the past, most farmers practised subsistence farming, and in many developing countries, that is still the case.
Subcultures bring together people who feel neglected by the mainstream, and enable them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be defined by age, ethnicity, class, place and/or sex of members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as such can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual or geographical.
The members of a subculture often signal their membership by a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits and jargon.
One of the most common ways of illustrating the importance of socialisation is to rely on the few unfortunate cases of children who have not been socialised by adults because of neglect, misfortune or deliberate maltreatment during their childhood.
Wild children are called "wild" or "wild". Some wild children have been kept captive by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, neglect was due to the inability of the parents to accept the severe intellectual or physical limitations of the child.
Wolf cubs may have suffered massive child abuse or experienced traumatic experiences before being abandoned or escaping.
Some have been reared by animals; others have lived alone in the wild.
If it was raised entirely by animals, it will display behaviours (in the context of its physical capabilities) that are almost completely in accordance with those of its specific carer, such as its fear or indifference to people.
Project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, but scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but rather a support that helps individuals in a new learning situation, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Armour can be virtual or real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but also the little office stapler in Microsoft Office.
Virtual assistance is built into the software and will help students to question and explain the steps which they alone may not be able to complete.
Children are placed in foster homes for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse, exploitation and extortion.
No child should be forced to grow up in a home environment that is not caring, loving and educationally oriented, but many are forced to do so.
For us, the care system is a piece of security for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving caregivers, a stable training and a reliable health care.
The care home should cover all the needs that they had not been able to meet in the home from which they had been removed.
The Internet connects both elements of mass communication, as well as interpersonal communication.
The specific features of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the value- and reward-approach.
For example, learning and socialisation are cited as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal engagement and sustained relationships were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied the public reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings led to important insights into the interpretation of microexpressions, short-lived facial movements.
In particular, it is claimed that one can identify a liar by deducing the slightest changes in facial expression.
In his article The President's Speech Oliver Sacks showed how people with a brain injury cannot understand the honesty of people, but still can correctly assess it.
He claims that the ability to interpret human behaviour may be shared with dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has demonstrated that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation causes new genetic variations and selection removes these from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with each generation back and forth.
Out in the savannah it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like ours to meet its nutritional needs from available plant sources.
In addition, it has serious consequences if you do not: depression, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The easiest to access plant resources would have been proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal foodstuffs (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide large amounts of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
In summary, it should not come as a surprise to us that our forefathers solved their "protein problem" in the same way that chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep compensation is the process of goal-directed awakening during normal sleep periods and the subsequent short sleep (10-60 minutes) later.
This can be achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without completely waking you up.
If you are someone who imagines the alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room so that you have to leave the bed to turn it off.
Another possible way of doing this is to drink a lot of fluids before going to bed (especially water or tea, which is known for its urinary-tonic effect), so that you have to get up to go to the toilet.
The measure of inner calm that a person has is inversely proportional to the degree of tension in the body and mind.
The lower the tension is, the more positive the existing life force. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can attain enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
The Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has been expanded to include the path of love of the Mahayana and numerous techniques of the Indian yoga.
The Tibetan Buddhism is quite simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (awakening energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The centre of Tibetan meditation is the god-yoga. Through visualising different gods, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are opened and the enlightened consciousness is born.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, which led to a cooperation between the USSR and the US. After the war, the collision of the systems, the course and the culture led to the countries being at loggerheads.
Two years after the end of the war, the former Allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
He should last for the next 40 years and be carried out in the real world by proxy armies on battlefields in Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defence was already completely broken down and the only hope was to retreat and reorganise along the Romanian bridgehead.
The plans were quickly obsolete when 800,000 Soviet soldiers invaded the white Russian and Ukrainian fronts and created, after they entered into violation of the Riga Pact, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements into the eastern regions of Poland.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is the most efficient means of transporting large human and goods masses over the oceans.
The task of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that a country is able to carry people and goods and at the same time to hinder the enemy's ability to do so.
One of the most significant recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign in the Second World War. The Americans tried to bring personnel and material across the Atlantic to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic mainly by submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Britain exactly as the rest of Europe.
It is thought that goats were domesticated in the Zagros Mountains in Iran around 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and peoples began to keep them as livestock to get easily at their milk, fur, skin and meat.
Sheep were usually kept in herds, which wandered on hills or other pasture areas. The cattle were cared for by shepherds, very similar to the more well-known sheep herders; often, it was children or adolescents. This
In England, as early as the 16th century, they built railways to support the growth of industry.
Because the railway tracks consisted of only parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull the carriages faster and to carry heavier loads than on the rougher roads of the time.
As early as the beginning of the century, rails were introduced to ensure the position of the rails. Gradually, however, it became apparent that rails that carried a band of iron were more efficient.
This was the customary practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron railway tracks were introduced.
The first known means of locomotion was walking. Man began walking about two million years ago with the appearance of the Homo erectus (which means "standing man").
Your predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not go on a regular basis.
Two-footed species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3,9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate future suffering a little.
This is in many cases merely a symptomatic treatment. If you are not only temporary solutions, then we should dig to the roots and treat the malady.
It is really obvious that the world has changed due to scientific and technological progress and that the problems caused by overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles of people have become more serious.
After its adoption by the Congress on 4 July, a handwritten draft, signed by the Congress President John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to the printer John Dunlap.
In the course of the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are known as "Dunlap broadsides" today.
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the Independence Hall on July 8.
A copy was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who read it to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy reached London on 10 August.
There are still 25 Dunlap broadsheets, which are the oldest still extant copies of the document. The original handwriting has not survived the times.
Many paleontologists now believe there is a group of dinosaurs that have survived and are still alive. We call them birds.
Many people do not see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and fly.
However, many things about birds still look like dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws, lay eggs and run on both hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the processing of information in binary form.
A binary number can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these are called binary digits - or bits, to use the computer jargon.
An internal poisoning can be difficult to detect. The symptoms, for example vomiting, are so general that you cannot immediately make a diagnosis.
The best evidence of a poisoning by ingestion is the presence of an open container of medicines or toxic household chemicals.
Look for specific first aid instructions for this specific poison on the label.
The term 'waste' is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this insect group.
This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs. These insects are very adaptable to parasitizing humans.
So both bedbugs and fleas are nidicolous, meaning that they live in their nests or in the homes of their hosts.
In the United States there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which is the most common neurological disease among adults aged between 20 and 40.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and the peripheral nerves.
According to research, the risk of developing MS is twice as great for women as for men.
A couple can decide that it is not in their own interest or in the interest of their child to raise a baby.
The couples can choose to adopt a plan for their baby.
When a child is adopted, the biological parents give up their parental rights, so that another couple can take on the parental responsibilities.
The main aim of science is to discover how the world works. This method is in fact the basis of most scientific investigations.
But it is not only about experimentation, where an experiment is a test that is used to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also guided by the setting of questions and the conduct of observations.
Natural scientists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all sciences, including psychology, were accepted.
With the loss of Greek language skills, Western Europe was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behaviour are often due to the presence of body-specific cycles and their production by biological clocks. x
A series of behaviors that are not only reactions to external cycles, but also are known in many living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that even in absence of external signals continue to oscillate for a period of time.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the most important evidences that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacteria.
They took two experiments, one in which they either labelled the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or a protein in the phage with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations can have different effects, depending on the type of mutation, what the relevant piece of genetic material means, and whether it is a germline cell.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Natur-based tourism draws people who are interested in visiting nature reserves, to enjoy the landscape, including the wild plants and animals.
Exemplary activities are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
One example is the visit, photography and studying orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave small provincial towns with their cars to their workplace and are passed by other people whose workplace is at the place they just left.
In this dynamic pendulum transport, all are connected to a transport system based on private cars, and support it.
Now, the science has pointed out that this massive carbon economy has brought the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has been the human evolution in the last two million years.
Everyone takes part in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport systems.
You will rarely hear complaints about the water quality or the collapse of bridges in developed countries.
Why do transport systems fail so often? Are transport engineers just incompetent? Or is there something fundamentally wrong going on here?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them.
It is difficult to study traffic flows because one cannot predict the behaviour of drivers with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, motorists tend to behave reasonably consistent; therefore, traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be mathematically expressed in a rough way.
To better represent the flow of traffic, the relationships between the three main characteristics have been defined: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of facilities on the road.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the sky. Their ability to fly helped them to evade enemies more easily and to find more efficient food and mates.
Most insects can fold their wings along their bodies.
They have a wider choice of small boots in which they can hide themselves from predators.
Little butterflies and moths are the only insects that cannot fold their wings.
A man named Aristarch claimed in the second century BC that the sun was at the centre of the movements of the solar system.
Many people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system including the sun (and even the other stars) revolved around the Earth.
That seems sensible, because it doesn't seem to you as if the earth were moving.
The Amazon River is the second longest and the most water-rich river in the world. It flows more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, with a width of up to six miles.
20 per cent of the water that flows through rivers on the planet is from the Amazon.
The Amazon main river is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It takes water from thousands of smaller rivers into it.
However, the construction of pyramids from stone up to the end of the Old Kingdom continued, and the pyramids of Gizeh in their size and the technical perfection of their construction were never surpassed.
Egyptians in the ancient New Kingdom admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were thousands of years old at the time.
Vatican City has a population of around 800 people. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the smallest population in the world.
Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language of most of those who work in the State, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known to mankind since the ancient times, since these can be found in their original form in nature and are extracted and reused with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, posited the theory that all things are made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This corresponded more to the four states of aggregation (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma. However, he also proposed the theory that they would transform into new substances to form what we see.
Metals are basically a mixture of two or more elements. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are regarded as metals. Of course there are other metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys containing low quantities of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
The universe is made up of matter in its entirety. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that billions of them would fit in the point at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was invented many people became good friends.
Unfortunately, the pencil has been pushed out of the limelight by the introduction of new writing methods, so that it has been marginalised in its status and use
Today, people write news on computer screens, without ever having to get close to a cliff edge.
We have every right to expect that something new will emerge from the keyboard when something more recent comes along.
The atomic bomb is based on the principle that energy is required to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like if you were to roll a heavy car up a hill. If the core is split again, some of this energy will be released.
Some atoms have unstable cores, which means that they will break down even at the slightest provocation.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The outer shell is about 70 km thick on the near side and about 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the sea and thicker under the highlands.
On the near side, there could be more Maria, as the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on what moves people or appeals to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are acquired through their growing up.
These theories deal with the reasons why certain people want to do exactly the things they do, and the influences in their environment that cause them to do or not to do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two types of behaviour can be observed when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the boys" (or of the girls) and the other end is the attempt to become 
This kind of manager has problems making difficult decisions, carrying out disciplinary action, issuing performance appraisals, assigning responsibility and enforcing accountability.
At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable individual who has to change everything as the team has done and takes everything for itself.
In the end, the manager is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behaviour often leads to friction between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are managed in the same way as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members have a function for their immediate physical group which often functions as a contact point.
They often have greater autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams may meet in different time zones that may not be taken into account by the local leadership.
The presence of a truly invisible team (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also an unique feature of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the leadership team that reports to each member. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization undertake the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? A goal for the practical implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation.
If all available resources are effectively used by all departments of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can arise.
In the end, the joint work of an organisation on overcoming a hindrance can lead to a new innovative process on responding to customer needs.
Before an organisation can be innovative, the leadership must develop a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and learning.
Angel (2006) explains the concept of the continuum as a method to help organisations become more efficient.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognitive processes. This limits the research field and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research.
It is well known that various types of brain damage, such as trauma, injuries and tumours, influence behaviour and cause changes in some brain functions.
New technologies are enabling us to see and explore certain brain structures and processes for the first time.
This will give us a lot of information and materials to build simulation models that will help us understand what is going on in our heads.
KI is not only strongly associated with science fiction, but is a fundamental branch of computer science, which deals with behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in the field of KI includes the production of machines for automating tasks that require intelligent behaviour.
The examples are control, the setting of strategies and timetables, the ability to answer customer questions and queries, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become autonomous disciplines that are focused on finding real solutions to the problems of the real world.
The artificial intelligence system is now used in many areas of industry, medicine, engineering and military, and is also incorporated into numerous software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of every school. Often a teacher would like to take her pupils to places where a coach journey is not possible.
Virtual field trips are a technical solution. Pupils can view museum pieces from their classrooms, visit aquariums or admire beautiful works of art.
Sharing a virtual trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and to share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennett School in North Carolina design and build a website every year about their trip to Washington, D.C. The website is updated every year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a collection album.
Blogs can also help improve the writing skills of pupils. Although pupils at the beginning of their blog experience often have poor grammar and spelling, this usually changes when there is a readership.
Students are often very critical audiences, so the blogger tries to improve his writing style to avoid criticism.
The blogging forces students to learn more about the world around them. The need to inspire interest in the audience motivates students to write intelligently and interestingly.
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages pupils to continue learning outside the traditional school day.
Blogs can help pupils become more analytical and critical, and by engaging in active response to Internet material, they can define their own positions in the context of texts by other people and present their own perspectives on particular topics.
Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital of Canada and is home to a number of art galleries and museums that present Canada's past and present.
In the south are the Niagara Falls, and in the north the untouched beauty of nature spreads out in Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and other characteristics make Ontario distinctive from other provinces as to what is considered to be typical of Canada.
The sparsely populated areas further north are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that many surprises: There are more African Americans in the US than Canadian citizens.
The islands of the Indian Ocean are located in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Africa.
Madagaskar is by far the largest and, what the animal world is concerned, a separate continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or part of France and known as luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to the country, and in the Comoros and Mayotte it was very successful.
The European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
The north is bounded by the Sahel zone and the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.

Women should recognise that cultural differences can lead to what they regard as an assault, and that it is not uncommon to be followed, handcuffed, etc.
Keep your principles firm, and don't be afraid to defend them (cultural differences, or not; that does not mean that it is okay!)
The modern Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century before the beginning of time and was used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Merinides as a strategic port with the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after a major earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan built the city as Dar el Beida again and it was called Casablanca by Spanish traders who established there trading bases.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
It is easy to find places in the old Medina where traditional Moroccan goods such as Tagines, pottery, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of tinned food are sold, but that is all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the extreme eastern part near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city, including the city centre, under its debris.
While Goma is relatively safe, it is important to plan your stay outside Goma carefully, in order to learn about the ongoing fighting in North Kivu.
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of the Nyiragongo volcano as well as for some of the cheapest gorilla tracking tours in Africa.
You can use Bodabodas (motorbike taxis) to get around Goma. The usual fare is about 500 Congolese Francs for a short ride.
This in combination with its relative remoteness has made "Timbuktu" a metaphor for exotic, faraway countries.
Although Timbuktu is regarded as a tourist attraction and has an airport, it is today a poor city.
In 1990, due to the threat of desert sand, it was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger.
It was one of the most important stops on Louis Gates' PBS special, "Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the cities of the country, because it is more of an Arab than an African feel to it.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the north-east of South Africa. It borders in the east with Mozambique, in the north with Zimbabwe and in the
The park has an area of 19 500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecosystems, each supporting a different animal species.
The Kruger National Park is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is regarded as the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As all South African national parks, the Park charges daily entry fees.
It can also be worthwhile to buy a wild card that allows access either to selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the namesake of the territory of Hong Kong and is the focus of many tourists.
The buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong are compared to a shimmering bar chart that is visible through the present of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, you should leave the island and head for the opposite shore of Kowloon.
The majority of the city-building of Hong Kong Island is concentrated along the newly acquired land along the north coast.
This is the place that the British colonists have taken over. If you look for traces of colonial history in the area, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forest in the world and extend for 80 km from the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland to the coast.
The Sundarbans were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But forests are not only mangrove swamps - they also include some of the last remaining remnants of the mighty forest that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans extend over an area of 3 850 square kilometres, of which a third is covered by water and marshes.
The Sundarbans are a nature reserve since 1966 and estimates indicate that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer there.
Buses run all day long from the district-wide bus station (on the other side of the river) and most buses, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30 am." #
Buses are often full, so it is advisable to buy a ticket in advance.
The majority of districts are being driven by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
Taxi services are a fast and comfortable way to get to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a curved cable bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 metres high, their length is 378 metres and they have two lanes with 3,50 m width.
The bridge's height is 15 meters. The construction work was completed in August 2011, but the opening for traffic was only completed in March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group that inhabited the present-day Paraguayan South. They hunted as semi-nomadic hunters,
The Chaco region was also the home of other indigenous groups, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering
Paraguay, formerly the province of West Indies, was formed in the 16th century as a result of the encounter of the Spanish conquistadors with the native
The Spaniards began the colonization period, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for its polo team and its players being among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at Las Cañitas Polo fields.
Small tournaments and competitions can also be watched at other times of the year.
Informations on competitions and ticket outlets for polo are available at the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is set in accordance with the value of the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged in the only bank on the island, which is located opposite the FIC West Store.
The pound is generally accepted everywhere on the islands and at Stanley credit cards. Also US dollars are often accepted.
In the remote islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, but British and US currency can be accepted; check with the owners in advance about the accepted payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland Islands' currency outside the islands themselves, so you should exchange your money before you leave the islands.
Mendoza is south of the equator, so it is there in summer when it is in the northern hemisphere winter, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics. In summer, temperatures can reach +30 °C.
The winter can be misleadingly cold: the temperatures rarely go below freezing point, but wind and humidity lead to feeling colder than what the thermometer shows.
There are no distinct seasons of rain or drought: The amount of rainfall remains about the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to the sight of people, the wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the instructions of the park authorities, visitors should keep at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals.
Even if Bisons, Wapitis, Elches, Bears and virtually all large animals can act peacefully, it can still happen that they turn on each other.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not take enough space. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so leave them enough space.
Be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife. Avoid carrying strong-smelling foods or cooking them and keep your storage clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa and has a population of around 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 18th century and is the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a shameful stalemate in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships except one British warship were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans died.
While the Mau-Movement was organising the independence struggle, a peaceful meeting in the city led to the killing of the chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
In Auckland there are two harbours, so there are many beaches. The most popular beaches are in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Most of the beaches are sandy with safe swimming and most offer shade, which is provided by the Pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located at the harbour of Waitemata, in the upper suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
There are family beaches that are sometimes overcrowded, with a beautiful promenade along the coast. Swimming is here safe.
The most important local beer is 'Number One'. It is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is 'Manta'.
There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may be better tolerated.
Local tap water can be safely drunk, but if you are worried, you will also find bottled water.
For Australians, the idea of coffee is ""flat white"" foreign. A small black is ""espresso"" and a cappuccino is high with foam (not with milk). Tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is Belgian standard. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many trips to the reef take place all year round, and injuries caused by any of these causes on the reef are rare.
However, you should follow the Council of authorities, all signs and particularly pay attention to health and safety warnings.
Shrimps are often seen in the vicinity of beaches and in the vicinity of river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can also be seen outside this
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and would run away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live in active waters, their primary habitat is in river mouths north of Rockhampton.
A reservation ahead of time gives the traveller the assurance that he will have a place to stay when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although you may also book other accommodation forms, such as tents, through a travel agency.
Travel agents usually offer packages in which breakfast, transport to and from the airport or even a combination of flight and hotel are included.
You can also hold your reservation for you if you need time to reconsider the offer or to obtain further documents for your destination (e.g. visas).
Any changes or requests should be made first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
In some festivals, the vast majority of festivalgoers decide to camp out, and most visitors believe that this is an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you have to be early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that there will be music playing on parts of the festival until late at night, even though the music has stopped on the main stages.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the position of the cabin, because the breaking of ice can cause quite a lot of noise for the most affected.
Cruise ships also offer time for a stay in St Petersburg. Passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos usually try very hard to keep their guests for as long as possible and to spend as much money as possible. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits are sometimes difficult to find.
You usually have a special offer of food, drink and entertainment to keep the guests entertained and ensure that they stay.
Some casinos offer alcoholic beverages for free. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good players know how important it is to remain sober.
Who wants to go up high or over mountains, should be prepared for snow, ice and temperatures below freezing.
On icy and snowy roads the liability is low and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
In a blizzard, snow can fall so fast that you can't move.
The visibility can also be impaired by falling or drifting snow or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, in many countries the weather is cold and snowy all the year round, and the traffic is running all the year round almost continuously.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
Safari is a term used in everyday language to describe a trip to Africa to see the incredible wildlife there.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, are prone to approach cars close to them, and the standard equipment allows good visibility.
Lions, leopards and cheetahs are often shy and you can observe them better with a telescope.
A bushwalk (also known as a "bushwalk", "walking safari" or "footing") consists of a walking trip which either takes several hours or several days." #
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held at other venues in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Olympic Summer Games, after having hosted the 1964 Summer Olympics.
If you have already booked your flights and accommodation for 2020, before the rescheduling was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
The cancellation rules vary, but from March onwards most of the cancellation rules were not valid until July 2020, for the Olympic Games that were planned.
It is estimated that most tickets will cost between ¥2500 and ¥130,000, a typical ticket will cost about ¥7,000.
Brushing wet clothes can help drying. Many hotels provide irons and ironing boards, even if you are not present in the room.
If there is no iron available or you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can try to use a hairdryer if one is available.
Please, do not heat it too much (it can shrink it or, in extreme cases, cause burns).
To clean water there are various methods. Some of them are more effective than others to prevent certain dangers.
In some areas, it is sufficient to boil water for one minute, whereas in others, it must be several minutes.
Filters vary greatly in effectiveness, and if you have any doubts, then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter livestock pests which they do not know from their home regions.
Infestations can destroy food, cause irritation or even cause allergic reactions, poison or transmit disease.
Infections as such or dangerous animals which can cause injury or death to humans are not usually classified as vermin.
Free shopping is the ability to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and duties at certain locations.
Travellers whose destination country has a high taxation rate can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, in particular on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmount on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway is the most challenging driving section, as it often leads through remote, undeveloped terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: steep gradients, narrow roads and sharp turns are prevalent here.
The speed limits given are significantly lower than in the previous and following sections - usually between 35 and 40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict compliance with them is even more important than usual.
But interestingly, the mobile coverage here is much better than in many other areas of the route, for example, the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German bread is very tasty. In Bavaria, it is very rich and varied, as well as in Austria.
Bread is widely used, with apples being boiled all year round and pears and plums being used in summer.
Many German cakes also contain nuts, almonds or other nuts. Popular cakes often go well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want to produce small, but rich baked goods, then try this, which is called in different regions as Berliner, pancakes or crêpes.
A curry is a dish that is based on herbs and spices, with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either dry or wet.
In the interior of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is usually used in curries; in South India and in some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is
Indonesian cuisine is a term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines, which are found throughout the country.
When the term is used without any further attributes, it usually refers to the food that originated from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine, which is now widely spread throughout the island group, offers a variety of simple spiced dishes. As flavouring agents, the Javans prefer nuts, chilis, sugar (especially javan coconut sugar) and a range of aromatic spices." #
Stitching is a kind of footwear for the riders, which hang down from both sides of the saddle.
They give the rider more stability, but there are security concerns because the feet of the rider may get caught in them.
If a rider falls off the horse and hooks his foot on the bridle, he can be dragged along if the horse passes.
First of all, most riders wear boots with a heel and a smooth, narrow sole.
In addition, some saddles, in particular English saddles, have safety buckles which make it possible for a saddle cinch to fall off when it is pulled off by a falling rider when the rider is on his back.
The Cochamó Valley - Chile's most important climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a number of large granite walls and -cliffs.
The summits offer a spectacular view. Climbers from all over the world discover new routes along the walls, which offer endless possibilities.
Skiing and snowboarding are popular sports, in which skis or snowboards are attached to your feet and you descend a slope on a snow covered surface.
Skiing is a popular holiday activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as'ski-penners' who plan their entire holiday around skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers go back as far as 5000 B.C.
The origins of skiing as a sport go back at least to the 17th century and in 1861 the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Skitouring with a backpack: This activity is also called skiing or skitouring.

In good conditions you can cover a greater distance than you can on a walking tour – only very rarely you will reach the speed of a ski tour without a heavy pack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has several independent countries. Normally you would have to apply for multiple visas and go through multiple passport controls if you want to travel through several countries.
The Schengen area works in this respect somewhat like a country.
So long as you remain within this zone, you can usually cross borders without having to go through the passport control again.
According to the agreement, you do not need to apply for a Schengen visa for each of the Schengen member states individually, which saves time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universally accepted definition of what is an antique. Some tax authorities define old goods as antiquities.
The definition has geographical deviations, where the age limit may be lower in parts of North America than in Europe.
Handmade products could be referred to as ‘antique’, although they are younger than similar products made from mass production.
The reindeer herding is a major source of livelihood for the Sámi and the culture around the trade is also important for many who work in other occupations.
Also in the past, not all Sámi hunted and raised reindeer in large numbers, but they lived mainly from fishing, hunting and similar activities.
Today, many Sámi work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.

Tourists are strongly advised to be on the lookout for any type of weather that affects their area, since this can have a significant impact on all travel
Anyone planning to travel to a country that is a war zone should undertake a professional training for that purpose.
A search for ""course on hostile environments"" is likely to show the address of a local firm.
A course covers the problems discussed in this discussion in a much more detailed way, usually combined with practical experience.
A course is usually for two to five days and includes role-playing, lots of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
There are many books and journals on survival in the wilderness, but very few publications on conflict zones.
Travellers planning to have a gender reassignment operation abroad must ensure that they have valid identity documents for their return.

The searches at security checks have become more intrusive in the wake of 11 September 2001.
Transgender people should not expect that their privacy and dignity will be protected when passing through the scanners.
River currents are the return current of broken waves, often at breakers or similar.
Because of the underwater topology, the return flow concentrates in a few deeper areas and a rapid current can form there.
The majority of deaths occur when people try to swim against the current, which is impossible.
When you get out of the current, it is not difficult to swim back.
You should try to get somewhere where you are not caught again. Alternatively, you should, depending on your skills and whether you were noticed, perhaps wait for rescue.
The shock of return is more intense than the shock of culture shock (the honeymoon phase is not as pronounced), lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travellers who found it easy to adapt to the new culture find it difficult to adapt to their own culture.
When you come back from an overseas stay, you have adapted to a different culture and have abandoned some of the behaviours of your home culture.
When you first travelled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding because they knew that travellers had to adapt to a new country.
Maybe we don't expect that returning travellers should also be shown patience and sensitivity.
The sound and light show at the Pyramids is one of the most interesting attractions for children in the area.
You can see the Pyramids in the dark and while it is still quiet before the show begins.

The northern part or the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak is the Mount Vinson at 4892 m.
In remote areas without mobile phone coverage a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a substitute for a mobile phone, since you have to be in clear sight of a satellite to make a call.

Finland is a great destination for boat tours. The "Land of the thousand lakes" has also thousands of islands - in the lakes and in the archipelagoes." #
For archipelagos and lakes, you do not necessarily need a boat.
In addition, even though the coastal island groups and the largest lakes are actually big enough for every yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is the national pastime in Finland, with one in six or eight owning a boat.
This is not comparable to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (in the Netherlands, one in fourty.)
Most Baltic Sea cruises include a longer stay in St. Petersburg in Russia.

If you only go on a tour of the countryside, you do not need a separate visa (Stand 2009).
Some cruises offer Berlin as a destination in Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and from all walks of life, especially if they have never flown or have a traumatic experience behind them.

The obvious way to fly first or business class is to pile on the cash (or, better still, force your company to pay for it).
But that is not cheap: As a rough guide, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business and the quadruple for first class!
It is pointless to look for discounts on direct flights from A to B, even if you are looking for business or first class seats.
The airlines know very well that there is a certain core group of air travellers who are prepared to pay a lot of money to be able to get to their destination quickly and easily and they demand appropriate prices.
The capital of Moldova is Kishinev. The native language is Romanian, but many people speak Russian.
Moldavia is a multiethnic republic, which has suffered from ethnic conflicts.

There are rare fauna such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, foxes, wild cats and hens, as well as many more common species.
When you visit monasteries, you have to wear skirts that reach up to your knees and cover your shoulders.
In most monasteries there are no dresses for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially a brightly coloured one, the monk or nun at the gate will smile at you.
