Most of our population has not changed in any fundamental respect. They still need the same kind of conditions.
Time will make them more comfortable in their new environment, and they will become less and less visible.
Finally, thousands or millions of years later, the two populations of the same species will look different enough to be considered different species.

For example, you can say that if a motor car is there, then it is necessary to develop the road.
The road network is however not economically viable for the majority of cars, and therefore the price of the car has been reduced by developing new production methods.

However, the plant-based diet of primates is not as easily achievable as that of humans.
Also, failure to treat can have serious consequences: growth depression, malnutrition and ultimately death.
