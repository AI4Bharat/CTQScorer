This confirms not only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides details that fossils in general cannot provide, such as colour and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the fur of this animal was brown on top and lighter on the underside.
The find also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well developed sheath called the quill, but other features of feathers – hooks and barbules – the researchers concluded that the quill must have been an evolutionarily later development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or for heart function.
Researchers claimed that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows no feathers, but rather a juvenile dinosaur's fur.

Although three people were in the house when the car drove into it, none of them were injured.
The driver suffered a head injury.
The road on which the accident took place was temporarily closed while the rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was taken to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
In consequence, he was transferred to the Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was charged with murdering her son in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court in the past.
She is in custody until the prosecution has been brought and the trial, but eyewitness statements could be exaggerated because of the widespread publication of
This is a practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish judiciary works differently, and the courts have considered the publication of photographs as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee comments: "Journalists seem to be crossing a dangerous line when they publish photographs etc. of suspects.
The Crown Office has hinted that at least until the prosecution of the case no further comments will be made.
According to a leak, the document is aimed at the border dispute in which the Palestinians demand a reversal of the borders in the state of 1967.
Other topics that are allegedly covered include the future of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the Jordan Valley.
Israel wants a military presence in the Jordan Valley for ten years from the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority is willing to accept a five-year presence only.
The hunters accompanying the experimental control should be closely supervised by rangers, since the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited to assist with the hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Managing Director of Park Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the four selected hunters received comprehensive security and training training.
Martelly has today appointed a new provisional electoral commission (CEP) with nine members.
It is his fifth CEP in four years.
Last month a Presidential Commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of the package of measures aimed at steering the country towards new elections.
The Commission was the response to the widespread regime-critical protests that began in October.
The trigger for the sometimes violent protests was the failure to hold elections, some of which are due to be held in 2011.
Over 60 cases of overheating have been reported with defective iPods. In total, six fires have been set and four people have suffered minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that it had 27 accidents in connection with the devices.
Last week, the METI announced that it had received 34 additional reports of overheating from Apple, which it described as "not serious
The Ministry of Finance responded by describing the Apple move as "really regrettable.
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Office for Civil Protection in the Northern Marians said that no damage has been reported in Laos.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center had also said that there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer abducted tourists from Hong Kong by forcing their bus into Manila, the capital of the Philippines, on 28 April 2007.
Rolando Mendoza shot with his M16 rifle at the tourists.
At least six hostages have been rescued and there have been confirmed deaths.
Six hostages, including the children and the elderly, were released, as well as the Filipino photographers, early on
The photographers took the place of an elderly lady as she went to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and went on to become a doctor.
He became a midwife and took up his work in the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working in the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature contractions.
His research showed that the application of a hormone accelerated the lung development of the foetus.
Xinhua reported that investigators from the government on Wednesday recovered two "black box" flight recorders.
Ringer colleagues paid tribute to Luna as well.
Tommy Dreamer said: ""Luna was the first queen of extremes. My first manager. Luna died in the night of the two moons. Very unique, exactly like her. A strong woman.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels gave the following comment: "Luna was as crazy as I was... maybe even crazier... I love her and I will miss her... hopefully she is in a better place.
Of the 1,400 people who were surveyed in the lead-up to the federal elections in 2010, 8 percent of those who opposed Australia becoming a republic have risen since 2008.
The present incumbent Prime Minister Julia Gillard has said during the election campaign for the federal election that she believes Australia will end up being a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 per cent of respondents share this view and want that Elizabeth II is the last Australian monarch.
29 per cent of respondents said Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 per cent said Australia should never become a republic.
The gold medal winner at the Olympic Games should swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three-person relays at the Commonwealth Games, but because of his many complaints his fitness was doubted.
He was not able to take the required medication to relieve his pain, as they are banned at the Commonwealth Games.
On 25 January, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer scientist at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Many people confirmed the discovery by using different hardware and software in February and on Tuesday it was announced.
Cosmic rays may have been a source of water supply for the earth, together with organic matter that forms proteins and allows life.
Because comets collided with the Earth long ago, they hope to gain insight into how planets, in particular the Earth, form.
Cuomo (53) took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He described the rumours as "political nonsense and idle chatter.
It is speculated that he may be a candidate for the presidency in 2016.
NextGen is a system claimed by the FAA that it would allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology rather than the older technology based on ground radar to enable the air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
There will not be any additional transport infrastructure established and the underground trains will not stop at Wembley. There are no parking or parking-and-ride facilities available at the venue.
With the fear of transport problems growing, the likelihood that the game would be played behind closed doors grew.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the emergence of a new bird species on the Galápagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and the Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species had developed within just two generations, despite the previous assumption that this process took much longer due to the mating between a native Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into a number of different forms. It can be rolled into tiny pieces.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can be bent and twisted. It can be hammered or rolled into leaves.
It can be made so thin that it sometimes was used to decorate handwritten pictures, called pictures, called pictureshandschriften.
This is known as the pH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator with red wine.
The carbonated beverage changes its colour, depending on whether it is acidic or basic (alkaline).
The pH level indicates the concentration of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemicals.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electrons (because hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and
Mix the two dry powders together and form them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a protective layer.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a septic tank in almost every house, which was connected to an elaborate sewa
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece." #
In ancient Egypt, Persia and China there were toilets. In Roman culture, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, which men and women visited in mixed company.
If you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back down to earth almost immediately.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and our view.
It will require a massive rocket with a height of more than 100 feet to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in astonishing ways. The greatest service it has given us is much easier and faster transport.
It has brought us the railway, the car and many other means of transport.
In addition to cats of medium size, which eat small prey animals, from rabbits to antelopes and deer,
Finally, there are many small cats (including stray domestic cats) that eat much smaller prey such as insects, rodents, amphibians, reptiles and birds
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a special task that every cat has and that ensures that they do not compete with other cats.
Lions are the most social cats. They live in large groups, which are called herds.
The herds consist of one to three adult males and up to thirty females and young males.
Women usually have a close relationship with each other when they live in a large family with sisters and daughters.
Lions act in a similar way to wolf packs or dogs, animals that resemble lions but are not as dangerous to their prey as lions are.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (if not particularly well), swim, jump long distances and pull with the fivefold power of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same family (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar." #
The roar of the tiger is not like the confident roar of the lion, but more like a series of grumbling grumbling words.
Ocelot eat small animals. If they can, they steal monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than he is.
Scientists think that otters track animals for food (prey) with their olfactory sense and find them by sniffing where they have been.
They can see in the dark very well and move undetected. Ocelots hunt their prey by matching their surroundings visually and then attacking their prey.
If a small group of animals (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it comes (for example, if they move across a mountain range or a river or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they did previously.
This new environment has other resources and other competitors, so that the new population needs to have different characteristics or adaptations in order to be a strong competitor than what it used to need.
The original population has not changed at all. It still needs the same adaptations as before.
As time goes by, the new population adapts to their new environment, and then they look less and less like the other population.
After thousands or millions of years, two populations will look so different that they will no longer be considered the same species.
This process is called specialization, which simply means the emergence of new species. It is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe in, and they take carbon dioxide out of the air that humans exhale (which means that they exhale).
Plants produce their food by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses out of plants and make clothes out of plants. We eat mainly plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the largest predator of its time, so it was afraid of nothing but other Mosasaurs.
His long jaws were equipped with more than 70 sharp teeth, including a second set on the tongue, which meant that there was no escape for any animal that crossed his path.
We do not know for sure, but he may have had a hooked tongue. He fed on seabirds, large fish, other Mosasaurs and was probably a cannibal.
He also took everything that came into the water; even a great dinosaur like the T. Rex was not big enough for him.
While most of their food is known to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual meals, including wild boar, peacock, snails and a kind of frog called the seven-headed snake.
Another difference was that the poor people and the women ate their food on chairs. The rich men preferred to hold banquets, where they sat on the side, while they ate their meals.
Courts of the ancient Roman Empire could not contain food that came from America or Asia in later centuries.
You had neither corn nor tomatoes nor potatoes nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever ate a turkey.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a temple which was regarded as the house of the god.
They offered sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to comply with the will of the gods through rituals and festivals.
Every temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner altar room, which only priests were permitted to enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses did not have such a great significance.
The greatest part of the life of the Hebrew family took place under the open sky.
The women cooked in the farm. Businesses were simply open to the street. For the construction of the house, stone was used.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so that wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the old Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled for murder from Iceland. When he continued westward, he found Greenland and gave it the name Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes lived there long before that.
Although all the countries were'scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the film ‘The Legacy of the Templars’, you may think that on the back of the Declaration of Independence there was drawn a treasure map.
That is not true. Although on the back of the document something is written, it is not a treasure map.
The words 'original declaration of independence, dated on 4 July 1776' were written on the back of the declaration.
Whether or not it was written by someone, it is known that the great scroll (which measures 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up at the beginning of its life to be stored.
It is therefore possible that the note simply was added as a label.
The landing on D-Day and the subsequent battles have freed the northern part of France, but the southern part of the country was still not free.
He was controlled by the "Vichy"" French. These were Frenchmen who signed a peace treaty with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders, rather than fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies landed in southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the French liberated the southern part of France and turned their attention towards Germany.
A civilization is a distinct culture shared by a significant number of people who live together and work together, a society.
The word 'civilisation' comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin word civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state and also somehow defines the size of a society.
Cities are the forerunners of nations. Civilised culture implies the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint and a proper dissemination.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving any significant historical evidence behind and fail to be recognised as genuine civilisations.
While the revolutionaries were fighting for independence, the 13 states formed on the basis of the Federal Treaty first formed a weak central government, consisting of the Congress.
The Congress was not empowered to tax, and there was no national executive or national judiciary, so it relied on the states for enforcement of its laws, which often did not cooperate.
He had no power to suspend tax laws and duties between states.
The articles required unanimous agreement of all states before they could be changed and states were not serious about the central government, so that their representatives often absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world and was 2006 FIFA World Champions.
Favourite sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula One motor racing.
 Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions and Italians take part in international competitions and Olympic Games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (of which Honshu is the largest), making it the seventh-largest island in the world.
Because of the archipelago/group of islands, Japan is often referred to as an archipelago.
The beginning of Taiwan goes back to the 15th century, when European sailors passed through the island and recorded the name as Ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
1624 the Dutch East India Company establishes a trading post in the southwest of Taiwan, which leads to a change in the methods of cultivation of the indigenous peoples and the employment of Chinese labourers on their rice and sugar plantation
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan and declared it a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
The Qing dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, after the defeat in the First Chinese-Japanese War, in which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is mainly made up of three buildings, namely the Intihuatana, the Sun Temple and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex were rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they looked originally.
Up to 1976, thirty per cent of Machu Picchu was restored, and the restoration work continues to this day.
For example, 35 mm is the most widely used film format in the world at the end of the analog film era.
It is still made, but more important is that its image format has been taken over by digital camera sensor formats.
In fact, the 35-mm-format is confusingly 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore referred to as 3:2.
Many of the usual formats (the APS format family, for example) have exactly the same or very similar aspect ratio.
The oft-maligned and often mocked third rule is a simple directive that creates dynamism and at the same time preserves some order in a picture." #
It states that the intersection of the lines that divide a picture vertically and horizontally is the most effective place for the main motif.
In this period of European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church was under scrutiny.
Since over a thousand years, Christianity has kept the European states together despite different languages and customs.
His omnipotence ruled every one, from the king to the common man.
One of the most important Christian beliefs is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty.
The central authority of the church was in Rome for more than a thousand years. This concentration of power and money led many to doubt whether this principle was adhered to.
In the immediate aftermath of the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective, as it cut off the country from vital military and civilian supplies, despite this blockade being contrary to the generally accepted international law, which has been codified in several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from penetrating whole oceanic regions, which posed a danger to neutral ships as well.
The response to this tactic was limited, and Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolation were the dominant attitudes of most citizens and countries.
After the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the nations of Europe wanted to avoid another such situation in the future.
1884 he moved to the United States of America to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the United States with only 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry and a recommendation letter from Charles Batchelor (his superior at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
The old China had a unique method of displaying different periods in China and each family in power was a separate dynasty.
In between the dynasties there were also unstable times of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the period of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and the Jin Dynasties.
In these times, there were bitter wars among many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The time of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died in the struggle for the highest throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metrical system, a departure from absolutism to republicanism and nationalism as well as the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
In addition, all jobs were open to all male applicants, so that the most ambitious and best could succeed.
The same applies to the military, because the ranks were based on the calibre of the weapons rather than on class membership.
The French Revolution inspired many oppressed people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed was very interested in things that went beyond the everyday life. He often visited a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Nur" (Light), to meditate.
The cave itself has survived the times and is a lively picture of Mohammed's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find even though you know that it exists. Once you are in the cave, you are completely isolated.
You can see nothing but the clear, beautiful sky and the numerous surrounding mountains. From the inside of the cave, very little of this world can be seen or heard.
The Cheops Pyramid is the only of the seven wonders of the world still standing.
The Cheops Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C. and is one of many great pyramid structures built to honor the dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau or the 'Gizeh Necropolis' in Egypt comprises several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built to honour the Pharaoh Cheops and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honour his wives and family members.
The "sprinkle" symbol looks like a V and the "sprinkle" symbol looks like a square, where the lower line is missing.
Up means that you should start at the top and pull the bow.
The erasing generates a softer sound, while the erasing is more powerful and expressive.
You are free to add your own pencil marks; however, the printed stave marks are there for musical reasons, so they should be respected.
The terrified King Louis XIV, Queen Marie Antoinette, her two small children (Marie-Therese, eleven years old, and Louis-Charles, four years old) as well as the sister of the king, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris by a mob of market women on 6 October 1789.
They travelled in a coach back to Paris, surrounded by a mob of people who threatened the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to open their windows.
Sometime later a member of the mob turned his head in the direction of a royal guard killed in Versailles.
The US imperialists' war expenditures in the Philippines were borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the U. S. to cover the bulk of expenditure, and the interest payments on the bonds flowed through the banks of the Wall Street in the name of the Philippine government." #
Of course, the superprofits that emanated from the continued exploitation of the Filipino people were the fundamental profits of the US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context in which they were founded.
The period in which the events took place is generally referred to as the Middle Ages, a period in European history that spanned the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended in approximately 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technology-push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that the human fate is determined by a fundamental logic which is linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas. Firstly, that the development of technology is a process that is largely beyond cultural or political influence and, secondly, that technology itself has effects on societies which are more intrinsic than socially determined.
It is possible to say that the personal motor vehicle is unavoidable in the development of roads.
However, a national road network for only a small number of cars is economically unviable. Therefore, new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The widespread ownership of cars also leads to an increased number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new technologies in the health sector to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a strong, cultural deterministic element, which was drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography was the entity that molded individuals. Over time, customs and cultures developed with reference to this geography and these, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
So, like Paris is now known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so was Constantinople the fashion capital of the empire-building Europe.
His fame as the centre of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
His status declined in the 12th century, mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices which were considered to be more valuable than the available byzantine markets.
At that time, too, the title of the world's fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic architecture reached its peak between the 10th and 14th centuries.
At the beginning, the clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
Although the styles in the West are 25 to 30 years behind the rest of the world, the Internet has made it possible for us to communicate more quickly.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people began to use buttons to fix their clothing as a result of the Crusades.
Needs management is agriculture that aims to produce as many food products as possible to meet the needs of the farmer or farmer's family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often biological farming method that uses surplus, locally available seeds and combines it with rotational farming or other relatively simple techniques to maximise yield.
In the past, most farmers practised subsistence farming and in many developing countries this is still the case.
Subcultures bring together people who feel neglected by society's norms and enable them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures might be defined by age, ethnicity, class, place and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as such can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual or geographical.
The members of a subculture often signal their membership by a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits and jargon.
One of the most common ways of illustrating the importance of socialization is to rely on the few unfortunate cases of children who have not been socialized by adults because of neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse during their childhood.
Wild children are called "wild" or "wild". Some wild children have been kept by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, neglect was the result of the parents' inability to accept the severe intellectual or physical limitations of the child.
Wolf cubs may have suffered severe child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were abandoned or fled.
Others have been reared by animals; some have lived alone in the wild.
If it has been raised entirely by animals, the wild child displays behaviours (in line with his physical capabilities) that are almost entirely in accordance with those of his specific carer, such as his fear or indifference towards people.
Project-based learning should make learning more interesting and easier, but scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but rather a support that helps individuals in a new learning situation, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Armatures can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of a framework, but also the little office stapler man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual assistances are built into the software and are intended to question, suggest and explain the steps that the student might not be able to carry out on his own.
Children are placed in a variety of reasons in foster care, ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion.
No child should be forced to grow up in a home environment that is not loving, nurturing and educationally oriented, but many are forced to do so.
For us, the care system is a piece of security for these children.
Our family care system should provide a safe home, loving carers, a stable training and a reliable health care.
The foster home will meet all the needs that they had not been able to receive in the home from which they had been removed.
The Internet connects elements of mass communication, as well as interpersonal communication.
The specific features of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the benefit-and-reward approach.
For example, learning and socialisation are cited as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal engagement and sustained relationships were also identified as new motivational factors by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined the public reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings led to important findings for the interpretation of microexpressions, short-lived facial movements.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect lying by deducing the minimal changes in facial expression.
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks showed how people who have lost the ability to understand language can still correctly assess the honesty of people.
He even claims that the ability to interpret human behaviour may be shared with animals such as dogs.
Scientific research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation results in new genetic variations and selection removes these from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with each generation in and out.
Out in the savannah, it is very difficult for a primate with a digestive system like ours to meet its protein needs from available plant sources.
In addition, it has serious consequences if you do not take action: depression, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most accessible plant resources would have been proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for us, unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal foods are easy to digest and provide large amounts of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
In general, it should not come as a surprise to us that our own forefathers solved their "protein problem" in the same way that chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep compensation is the process of targeted wakefulness during the normal sleep periods and the period of short sleep (10-60 minutes) later.
This can be achieved by means of a relatively quiet alarm clock, so that you are awakened without completely waking you up.
If you are someone who imagines the alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room so that you have to leave the bed to turn it off.
Another way of basing the diet on the circadian rhythm is to drink a lot of water (especially water or tea, which is known for its diuretic effect) in the evening, so that you have to get up to go to the
The degree of inner calm that a person has is inversely related to the degree of tension in the body and mind.
The lower the tension is, the more positive the potential of the person is. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can attain enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tenseness and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded to include the path of love of the Mahayana and numerous techniques of the Indian yoga.
In principle, the Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (Kriya-Energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The centre of Tibetan meditation is the goddess yoga. By visualising various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are opened and the enlightened consciousness arises.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war, the collision of systems, the course and the culture led to the fact that the countries fought each other.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
He should last for the next 40 years and be carried out in the real world by proxy armies on battlefields in Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defence was already completely broken down and the only hope was in a retreat and a reorganisation along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans were quickly obsolete when over 800,000 Soviet soldiers invaded the white Russian and Ukrainian fronts and created, after they invaded in violation of the Riga Pact, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements into the eastern regions of Poland.
The use of ships for transporting goods is the most efficient way of transporting large numbers of people and goods over the oceans.
The task of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that a country is able to transport people and goods, and to simultaneously prevent the enemy from doing so.
One of the most important recent examples of this is the North Atlantic Campaign during World War II. The Americans attempted to bring personnel and material across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic mainly with submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Britain exactly as the rest of Europe.
It is thought that goats were domesticated in the Zagros Mountains in Iran some 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and peoples began to keep them as livestock to get easily at their milk, fur, skin and meat.
Sheep were usually kept in herds, which wandered around hills or other pasture areas. They were cared for by shepherds, just like the more familiar sheepherders; often were they children or adolescents. This grazing system is still used
In the 16th century, engineers in England built railways.
While the railway tracks were only made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses to move at higher speeds and to carry heavier loads than on the rougher roads of the time.
In the early days, it was decided that the rails should be protected by barriers. Gradually, however, it became apparent that rails with a railway track were more efficient.
This was the customary practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron railway tracks were introduced.
The first known means of locomotion was walking. Man began to walk about two million years ago with the appearance of the Homo erectus (which means "standing man").
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk so regularly.
Two-footed species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3,9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can live more sustainably, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate future suffering a little.
It is in many cases merely a symptomatic treatment. If you are not only temporary solutions, then we should find the root of the problem and treat it.
It is plainly obvious that the world has changed due to the scientific and technological progress of humanity and that the problems caused by overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles of people have become more serious.
After its adoption by the Congress on 4 July, a handwritten draft, signed by the Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to the printers of John Dunlap some blocks away.
In the course of the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as "Dunlap broadsides.
The first reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the Independence Hall on 8 July.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
There are still 25 Dunlap broadsides, which are the oldest still existing copies of the document. The original handwriting has not survived the times.
Many paleontologists now believe that there is a group of dinosaurs that have survived and still live today. We call them birds.
Many people do not see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But many things in birds still look like dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and run on both hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
Almost all computers today are based on the processing of information in binary form.
A binary number can only have one of two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or as bits, to use computer jargon.
An internal poisoning can be detected only after a period of time. The symptoms, for example vomiting, are so general that it is not immediately possible to make a diagnosis.
The best sign of a poisoning by ingestion is the presence of an open container of medicines or toxic household chemicals.
Look for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison on the label.
The term 'wasp' is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this insect group.
This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs. These insects are very adaptable to parasitizing people.
Rabies and bedbugs are nidicolous, i.e. adapted to live in their nests or homes.
In the United States there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which is the most common neurological disease in adults aged between 20 and 40 years.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves.
Research has shown that the risk of developing MS is twice as high in women as in men.
A couple can decide that it is not in their own interest or in the interests of their child to raise a baby.
These couples can decide on a plan for adoption for their baby.
When adopting, the biological parents give up their parental rights, so that another couple can take on the parental responsibilities.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world works. This method is in fact the basis of most scientific investigations.
It is not only about experimentation, but also about testing hypotheses, which is a test that aims to exclude or confirm one or more of the possible hypotheses.
Scientists and philosophers have mainly focused on classical texts and have tended to focus on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were widely accepted.
With the loss of Greek language skills, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behaviour are often largely due to the presence of body-specific rhythms and their production by biological clocks.
From a cycle certain behaviours are known in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators which even in absence of external signals continue to oscillate in free-swinging cycles.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the most significant evidences that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacteria.
They took two experiments, one in which they either marked the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphor or a protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material involved, and whether it is a germline cell.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Natur tourism draws people who are interested in visiting nature reserves, to enjoy the landscape, including the wild flora and fauna.
Exemplary activities are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
A good example of this is the visit, the photographing and the studying of orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave small provincial towns with their cars to go to their workplace and are passed by others whose workplace is the place they just left.
In this dynamic pendulum transport, everyone is in some way connected to a transport system based on private cars, and supports it.
The science now points out that this massive carbon economy has brought about a radical change in the ecosystem from one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution for the last two million years,
Everyone takes part in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport systems.
You will rarely hear complaints about the water quality or the collapse of bridges in developed countries.
Why do transport systems fail so often? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something fundamentally wrong going on here?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them.
It is a pity that studying traffic flows is difficult, because it is not possible to predict driver behaviour with certainty.
Unfortunately, drivers tend to behave reasonably, so that traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be represented mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, the relationships between the three main characteristics were defined: (1) river, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of road facilities.
The first animals to conquer the skies were insects. Their ability to fly enabled them to evade enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects can fold their wings along their bodies.
They have a wider choice of small boots in which they can hide themselves from thieves.
Today, butterflies and moths are the only insects that cannot fold their wings.
In the past, a man named Aristarch claimed that the sun was at the centre of the movements of the solar system.
Many people thought he was right, but many people still believed that the solar system including the sun (and even the other stars) revolved around the earth.
It seems reasonable to me, because it doesn't seem to me that the earth moves.
The Amazon is the second longest and the most water-rich river in the world. It flows more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, with some stretches of up to six miles wide.
20 per cent of the water that flows over the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon main stream is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It takes water from thousands of smaller rivers into it.
While the construction of pyramids continued in stone until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Great Pyramid of Giza in its size and the technical perfection of its construction never surpassed that of the pyramids of
Egyptians in the ancient New Kingdom marvelled at the monuments of their forefathers, which were over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of around 800 people. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language of most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known to mankind for thousands of years, since these can be found in their original form in nature and are easily extracted with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, posited the theory that all things are made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements. This mixture was earth, water, air and fire.
This was more in line with the four states of aggregation (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma. He also posited the theory that they would transform into new substances to form what we see.
Metals are a mixture of two or more elements. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered as metals. There are also other metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
The universe is made up of matter in its entirety. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that billions of them would fit into the point at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was invented by many people a good friend.
It is unfortunate that the pencil has been pushed into the background by the introduction of new writing methods, so that it has lost its status and its use.
Today, people write their messages on computer screens, without ever having to touch a cursor.
It will be interesting to see what the keyboard will look like when something new comes along.
The atomic bomb is based on the principle that energy is required to combine a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like if you were to roll a heavy car up a hill. When the core is split, some of that energy will be released.
Some atoms have unstable cores, which means that they can disintegrate even at low or zero velocity.
The surface of the moon consists of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The outer layer is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the sea and thicker under the highlands.
On the near side, there will be more Maria, because the crust is thinner." It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Theoretical theories focus on what moves people or attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized over time.
These theories deal with the reasons why certain people want exactly the things they do and what influences in their environment cause them to do or not to do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two behaviours can be observed when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to "become one of the boys" (or of the girls) or to remain in the same company.
This kind of manager has problems in making unpopular decisions, to impose disciplinary measures, to assign responsibility, and to take people into account.
At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable individual who must do everything differently than the team has done and take everything for himself.
Finally, the manager is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behaviour often leads to friction between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are led in the same way as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members have a very close physical group for them, often having the function of a contact point.
They often have greater autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams may meet in different time zones, which may not be taken into account by the local leadership.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also an unique component of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the leadership team that reports to each member. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organisation undertake the time-consuming process of introducing an organisational learning concept? A target for the practical implementation of organisational learning concepts is innovation.
If all available resources are effectively used by all departments of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can arise.
In the end, the joint work of an organisation can lead to a new innovative approach to addressing a new obstacle to customer needs.
Before an organisation can be innovative, the leadership must develop a culture of innovation and shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the concept of the continuum as a method to help organizations become more effective.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognitive abilities. This limits the research field and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that various types of brain damage such as trauma, injuries and tumours can influence behaviour and cause changes in some brain functions.
New technologies allow us to see and explore certain brain structures and processes for the first time.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our heads.
KI is not only strongly associated with science fiction, but is also a major branch of computer science, which deals with behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in the field of KI includes the production of machines for automating tasks that require intelligent behaviour.
Some examples are control, the setting of strategies and timetables, the ability to answer customer questions and diagnoses, handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines that are focused on finding solutions to problems of the real world.
The artificial intelligence system is being used today in many areas of economics, medicine, engineering and military, and is also incorporated into numerous software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of every school class. Often a teacher would like to take her pupils to places where a bus trip is not possible.
Virtual field trips are a technical solution. Pupils can view museum objects, visit aquariums or admire beautiful art works from the comfort of their classroom.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design each year a website about their trip to the capital of the state. The website is updated each year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a collection album.
Blogs can also help improve the writing skills of students. Although students at the beginning of their blog experience often have poor grammar and spelling, this usually changes as a result of a readership.
Students are often very critical audiences, so the blogger tries to improve his writing style to avoid criticism.
Blogs force students to learn more about the world around them. The need to inspire interest in the audience motivates students to write intelligently and interestingly.
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to continue learning outside of the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can help students to become more analytical and critical; by responding to Internet material, students can define their own positions in relation to texts by others and present their own perspectives on particular topics.
Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital of Canada and is home to a number of art galleries and museums that present Canada's past and present.
In the South are the Niagara Falls, and in the North, the untouched beauty of nature spreads out to Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and other things make Ontario unique as what is seen by outsiders as typical of Canada.
A large part of the northern regions are sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that many surprises: there are more African Americans in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The Indian Ocean islands are situated in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the biggest and, as far as the animal world is concerned, a separate continent.
The smallest of the smaller islands are independent nations or part of France and are known for their luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to the islands and it was very successful there.
The European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
The region is bounded by the Sahel zone in the north and by the Atlantic Ocean in the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all women travelling claim to be married irrespective of their actual marital status.
Also wearing a ring is helpful (don't wear a ring that looks too expensive).
Women should recognise that cultural differences can lead to what they regard as harassment, and that it is not uncommon to be grabbed, tied up, etc.
Keep firm when you reject men and beware not to be afraid to defend your position (cultural differences aside; that does not mean that it is okay!)
The present Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Merinides as a strategic port with the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed them and rebuilt them under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon them after a quake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Dar el Beida and it was called Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
It is easy to find places in the old Medina where traditional Moroccan goods such as Tagines, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of tinned food are sold, but that is all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the extreme eastern part near Rwanda.
In 2002 the city of Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city, especially the city centre, under itself." #
While Goma is relatively safe, every stay outside Goma should be carefully planned to learn about the ongoing fighting in the province of North-Kivu.
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of the volcano Nyiragongo and for some of the cheapest gorilla tracking tours in Africa.
You can use Bodabodas (motorbike taxis) to get around Goma. The usual (local) fare is about 500 Congolese Francs for a short ride
This in combination with its relative remoteness has made it a metaphor for exotic, faraway countries.
Although Timbuktu is regarded as a tourist attraction and has a airport, it is today a poor city.
In 1990, the threat of desert sand was added to the list of World Heritage Sites at risk.
It was one of the most important stops on the PBS special "Africa's Wonders" by Louis Gates.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the cities of the country, because it is more of an Arab than an African feel to it.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa. It borders in the east with Mozambique, in the north with Namibia and in
The park has an area of 19 500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecosystems, each supporting a different animal species.
He is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is regarded as the symbol of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As all South African national parks, the Kruger National Park charges daily entry fees.
It may also be worth buying a wild card, which grants access either to selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the namesake of the territory and is the focus of many tourists.
The buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline were compared to a shimmering bar chart that is visible through the presence of the waters of the Victoria Harbour.
For the best prospects of Hong Kong, you should leave the island and drive to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
The majority of the city formation of Hong Kong Island is concentrated along the newly acquired land along the north coast.
This is the place that the British colonists have taken over. If you look for traces of colonial history in the area, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forest in the world and extend over 80 km from the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland to the coast.
The Sundarbans were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is known as Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not only mangrove swamps - they also encompass some of the last remaining remnants of the mighty jungle that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third is covered by water and marshes.
The Sundarbans are a nature reserve since 1966, and estimates suggest that there are now up to 400 Bengal tigers and up to 30,000 leopards in the area.
Buses run all day long from the district-wide bus station (on the other side of the river) and leave at various times, with most leaving between 06:30 and 07:30 in the morning.
Buses between the districts are often full, so it is advisable to buy a ticket in advance.
Most districts will be served by small Japanese coaster buses which are comfortable and stable.
Taxi-hailing services offer a fast and convenient way to get to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a curved cable bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 metres high, their length is 378 metres and they have two lanes with 3,50 m width.
The bridge's height is 15 meters. The construction work was completed in August 2011, but the opening of the road was delayed until March 2017.
The bridge will be completed in September 2017 and will be operational by then.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group that inhabited the present-day eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also
The Chaco region was also the home of other indigenous groups, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering
Paraguay, formerly the province of West Indies, was created in the 16th century as a result of the meeting of Spanish conquistadors with the native Indian
The Spaniards began the colonization period that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for its polo team and players to be among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at Las Cañitas Polo fields.
Small tournaments and competitions can also be watched at other times of the year.
Informations about polo competitions and polo ticket outlets can be found at the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is set in accordance with the value of the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged in the only bank on the island, which is located opposite the FIC West Store.
The British pound will generally be accepted everywhere on the islands and at Stanley credit cards. Also US dollars are often accepted.
On the remote islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, but British and American currency can be accepted; check with the owners in advance about which payment method is accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so you should exchange your money before you leave the islands.
As Montevideo is south of the equator, it is there summer when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the tropics. In the summer months, temperatures can reach +30°C.
The winter can be misleadingly cold: The temperatures rarely go below freezing, but wind and moisture lead to a feeling of colder than the temperature on the thermometer.
There are no pronounced rain or drought periods: The amount of rainfall remains the same over the whole year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to the sight of people, they are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authority, visitors should avoid at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals.
Even if Bisons, Wapitis, Elches, Bears and virtually all large animals can appear to be peaceful, it can still happen that they turn on each other.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not take enough space. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so leave them plenty of room.
Be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife. Avoid carrying strong-smelling foods or cooking them and keep your storage area clean.
Apia is the capital of the island of Upolu and has a population of around 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 18th century and is the official capital of Samoa today.
The port was the scene of a shameful stalemate in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships except one British cruiser were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans died.
While the Mau movement organised a peaceful demonstration in the city, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the killing of the chief of the Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III tribe." #
In Auckland there are two harbours, so there are many beaches. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Most of the beaches are sandy with safe swimming and most offer shade from the Pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located at the port of Waitemata, in the upper suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
There are family beaches, which are sometimes overcrowded, with a beautiful promenade along the coast. Swimming is safe here.
The most important local beer is "Number One". It is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is "Manta".
There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may be better tolerated.
Local tap water can be safely consumed, but if you are concerned about it, you will also find bottled water.
For Australians, the idea of coffee ""flat white"" is foreign. A small black is ""espresso"" and a cappuccino is high with foam (not with milk) and tea is served without milk
Hot chocolate is Belgian standard. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many trips to the reef take place all year round and injuries caused by any of these causes on the reef are rare.
However, you should follow the advice of authorities, all signs and especially pay attention to safety warnings.
Shrimps are often seen in the vicinity of river mouths and in the vicinity of estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They can also be seen outside
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and would flee.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live in the sea, their primary habitat is in river mouths north of Rockhampton.
A reservation in advance gives the tourist the assurance that he will have a place to stay upon his arrival at the destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although they may also book other accommodation, such as tents, through a travel agency.
Travel agents usually offer packages in which breakfast, transport to and from the airport or even a combination of flight and hotel are included.
You can also hold your reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain further documents for your destination (for example, a visa).
Any changes or requests should be made first to the travel agency and not directly to the hotel.
Many festivals are decided by a large majority of festivalgoers to camp out and most visitors believe that this is an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to be early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that on some of the festival stages, music will continue to be played until late into the night even though the music on the main stages has stopped.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the North Sea in winter, check the state of the cabin, as breaking ice can cause quite a disturbance for the most vulnerable sections of the population.
Cruises to St. Petersburg also offer the opportunity to spend time in the city. Passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
Casinos are usually very keen to keep guests for as long as possible and to spend as much money as possible. There are usually no windows or watches, and exits are sometimes difficult to find.
They usually have a special offer to keep the guests entertained and ensure that they stay.
Some casinos offer alcoholic beverages free of charge. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good players know how important it is to remain sober." #
If you want to travel in high latitudes or over mountain passes, you should be prepared for snow, ice and temperatures below freezing.
On icy and snowy roads, the liability is low and one cannot drive as if one were on bare asphalt.
In very short time, so much snow can fall that you can get stuck.
The visibility can also be impaired by falling or drifting snow or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, cold and snowy conditions are normal in many countries and the traffic runs all year round almost continuously.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari refers to a typical travel experience in Africa, to observe the overwhelming African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars close to them, and the standard equipment allows good visibility.
Lion, leopard and cheetah are often shy and you can observe them better with a telescope.
A bushwalk is a walk which lasts for a few hours or a few days.
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will take place at other venues in all Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Olympic Summer Games after it already hosted the 1964 Summer Olympics.
If you have booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the change was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
The cancellation policies vary, but from mid-March most cancellation policies did not apply until July 2020, for the Olympic Games that were planned.
It is estimated that most tickets will cost between 2500¥ and 130,000¥, a typical ticket will cost about 7000¥.
Dry clothes can help to dry out. Many hotels provide irons and ironing boards, even if you are not present in the room.
If no iron is available or you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer if one is available.
Please be careful that the material does not get too hot (it can shrink it or lead to burns in extreme cases).
There are various methods for cleaning water. Some of them prove to be more effective than others in dealing with particular threats.
In some areas it is enough to boil water for a minute, in others it must be several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you have any concerns, then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers can come across animal pests that they do not know from their home regions.
Infestation can destroy food, cause irritation or even cause allergic reactions, give poison or transmit diseases.
Infections as such or dangerous animals which can cause injury or death to people are not normally classified as vermin.
Free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and consumption taxes at certain locations.
Travellers who have a destination country with a high tax rate can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, particularly in the case of alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmount on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway is the most challenging section, as it often leads through remote, undeveloped countryside.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: steep gradients, narrow roads and sharp bends are more prevalent here.
The speed limits given are noticeably lower than those given in the previous and following sections - usually between 35 and 40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict compliance with them is even more important than usual
But interestingly, the mobile coverage here is much better than in many other areas of the route, for example, the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German bread is very tasty. In Bavaria it is very nutritious and varied, as well as in Austria.
Sweets are widely available, with apples being boiled all year round and pears and plums being used in summer.
Many German baked goods also contain nuts, almonds or other nuts. Popular cakes often fit particularly well to a cup of strong coffee.
If you want to produce small, but rich baked goods, try this, which is called Berliner, pancakes or crêpes in different regions.
A curry is a dish that is based on herbs and spices, with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either dry or wet depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is usually used in curries; in southern India and in some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is
With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a catch-all term that encompasses a wide range of regional cuisines that can be found throughout the country
When the term is used without any further attributes, it usually refers to the food that originates from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine, which is now widely spread throughout the archipelago, offers a variety of simple spiced dishes. As flavouring agents, the Javans prefer nuts, chillies, sugar (especially javan coconut sugar) and a number of aromatic spices.
Stitching is a kind of aid for the feet of the riders, which hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They give the horse more stability, but there are safety concerns because the feet of the horse may get caught in them.
If a horse falls off the horse and gets caught on the stirrup, it can be dragged along if the horse passes. To minimise this risk, a number of precautions can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear boots with a heel and a smooth, narrow sole.
In addition, some saddles, in particular English saddles, have safety buckles which allow the saddle to fall when it is pulled back by a falling rider.
The Cochamó Valley – Chile's most important climbing destination, known as the Yosemite National Park of South America, with a large number of large granite walls and cliffs.
The summits offer a breathtaking view. Climbers from all over the world discover new routes along the walls, which offer endless possibilities.
Skiing and snowboarding are popular sports in which skis or snowboards are attached to the feet and descended over a snow covered slope.
Skiing is a popular holiday activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski-penners", who plan their entire holiday around skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depicting skiers go back as far as 5000 B.C.
The origins of skiing as a sport go back at least as far as the 17th century and in 1861 the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by Norwegians." #
Backpacking with a backpack: This activity is also known as ski touring or ski walking.
It resembles alpine skiing or mountaineering, but it does not necessarily require it, as it is carried out in steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Look at the ski route as a comparable hiking route.
In good health you can cover a greater distance than you can on a walking trip – only very rarely will you reach the speed of a skiing trip without a heavy pack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has several independent countries. Normally, one would have to apply for multiple visas and go through multiple passport controls if one wanted to travel through several countries.
The Schengen area works in this respect somewhat like a country.
So long as one remains in this zone, one can usually cross the border without having to go through the passport control again.
In accordance with the new rules, you will not have to apply for a Schengen visa for each of the Schengen member states individually, which saves time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universally accepted definition of what is an antique. Some tax authorities define over 100 years old goods as antiquities.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be lower in areas such as North America than in Europe.
Handmade products could be referred to as "antique" even though they are younger than similar products produced in mass production.
The reindeer breeding industry is a major source of income for the Sámi, and the culture around the trade is also important for many who work in other occupations.
Also in the past, not all Sámi have been raising reindeer in large numbers, but have been living off fishing, hunting and similar activities.
Today, many Sámi work in modern professions. Tourism is a significant source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
Also although the term ""Gypsy"" is most commonly used by non-Roma, it is often perceived as offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma.
If you are visiting a country that issues a travel warning, your travel insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also consult the advice of other governments as your own. Their advice is however tailored to the citizens of their own country.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may be confronted with other situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Conferences are merely a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views expressed are often superficial, general and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information that can be found elsewhere.
Flooding is the umbrella term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, social disruption or loss of life.
Floods can occur anywhere on the planet and there are various types of them, which depend on the geography, topography and the atmospheric conditions
Strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall and forest fires are forms and effects of weather phenomena, as well as thunderstorms, tornado
Regional and seasonal weather phenomena are, for example, blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
Tourists are strongly advised to pay attention to any type of weather that affects their area, as this may affect all their travel plans.
Everyone planning to travel to a country that is considered a war zone should have a professional training for that purpose.
A search on the Internet for ""course on hostile environments"" will probably show the address of a local company.
A course covers most of the problems discussed in this discussion in a much more detailed manner, usually combined with practical experience.
A course is usually between 2 and 5 days long and includes role-playing, lots of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
There are many books and journals on survival in the wilderness, but very few publications on conflict zones.
Travellers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure that they have valid identity documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with a non-specified gender (X) or documents that have been updated to reflect the desired name and gender is different.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognise these documents is also very different.
The searches at security checks have become more intrusive in the wake of 11 September 2001.
Transgender people should not expect that their privacy and dignity will be respected when passing through the scanners.
Riss-currents are the flow of broken waves, often at reefs or similar.
Because of the underwater topology, the return flow concentrates in a few deeper areas and a fast current can form there.
Most deaths occur by exhaustion trying to swim against the current, which is impossible.
When one gets out of the current, it is not difficult to get back in.
You should try to get somewhere where you are not caught. Alternatively, you should, depending on your skills and whether you were noticed, perhaps wait for rescue.
The shock of return is earlier than the shock of culture shock (the honeymoon phase is not as pronounced), lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travellers who adapted easily to the new culture find it difficult to adapt to their home culture.
When you return home after a foreign study abroad, you have adapted to a different culture and have abandoned some of the behaviours of your home culture.
When you first travelled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding because they knew that travellers had to adapt to a new country.
Maybe it is not expected that returning travellers should be patient and understanding.
The sound and light show at the Pyramids is one of the most interesting attractions for children in the area.
You can see the Pyramids in the dark and while it is still quiet before the show begins.
Normally, one hears the sounds of tourists and vendors. The history of sounds and light is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx is used as a background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are shown on the Pyramids, with the different Pyramids being illuminated.
The Southern Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most stations. In 2020 there were sixteen active.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Another island is Livingston Island and Deception, where the overflowing caldera of an active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbour.
Elsworthland is the region south of the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula rise here and then descend again, forming the 360-km long chain of Ellsworth Mountains, which splits the Minnesota Glacier into two.
The northern part or the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains of the Antarctic, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak is the Mount Vinson with 4892 m height.
In remote areas without mobile phone coverage satellite phones may be the only option.
A satellite phone is not a substitute for a mobile phone, because you have to be in clear sight of a satellite to make a call.
The service is often used by ships, including pleasure ships, as well as expeditions that require data and voice links.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with further information about the connection to this service.
An increasingly popular option for people planning to take a year off work is to study and take courses abroad.
This is particularly popular amongst university graduates, because it enables them to take a year off without affecting their studies.
In many cases, taking part in a trans-national mobility programme can actually improve your chances of obtaining a higher education in your home country.
In most cases, a fee is charged for the registration to these educational programmes.
Finland is a great destination for boat trips. The "land of thousand lakes" has also thousands of islands - in the lakes and in the archipelagoes.
For the archipelagos and lakes you do not necessarily need a boat.
In addition, even though the coastal island groups and the largest lakes are actually large enough for every boat, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is the national pastime in Finland, with one in six or eight owning a boat.
This is in fact comparable with Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, one in four.)
Most Eastbound cruises include a longer stay in St. Petersburg in Russia.
That means you can visit the historic city for several days while you stay overnight on the ship.
If you only go on a tour of the countryside, you do not need a separate visa (Stand 2009).
Many cruises offer Berlin as a destination in Germany. You can see on the map above that Berlin is far from the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Travelling can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and from all walks of life, especially if they have never travelled or had a traumatic experience behind them.
This is nothing but the personal fears and prejudices that many people have.
To learn more about the workings of aircraft and the processes that take place during a flight, can help some to overcome their fear of the unknown or the feeling of not having control.
Courier companies are paid well for the speedy delivery of things. Frequently, the time is a very important factor in documents, trade goods or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the larger companies use their own aircraft, but on other routes and for smaller companies there were difficulties.
If they shipped via air freight, they could have had to clear customs and de-load and re-load on several routes several days in advance.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as unaccompanied baggage. The airline regulations do not allow it to be sent without a passenger, and you come in to play.
The obvious way to fly in first or business class is to put a wad of cash on the table (or, better yet, force your company to pay for it).
But that is not cheap: As a rough guide, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal Economy fare for the Business and the Elffache for the first class!
It is pointless to look for discounts on direct flights from A to B even if you are looking for business or first class seats.
The airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of flyers who are prepared to pay a lot of money to be able to get to their destination quickly and comfortably and demand the appropriate prices.
The capital of Moldova is Kishinev. The native language is Romanian, but many people speak also Russian.
Moldavia is a multiethnic republic, which has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
The conflict in 1994 led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognised by any UN member state.
While the political negotiations failed, economic relations between these two parts of the Republic of Moldova have been restored.
The most important religion in Moldova is the Christian Orthodox.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest harbour after Istanbul and a very good transport hub.
The once ancient city of Smyrna is today a modern, progressive and prosperous business centre, located on a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.

When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts that reach up to the knees, and they must cover their shoulders.
In most monasteries there are no dresses for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially a brightly coloured one, the monk or nun will smile at you at the gate.
Similarly, men should wear trousers that reach below the knees.
Also, these can be borrowed from the stock, but the clothes are not washed after each user, so you may not feel comfortable in these shirts." For men there is a uniform size!
The mallorcan cuisine is based, as in similar areas of the Mediterranean, on bread, vegetables and meat (in particular pork) and uses olive oil.
A simple and popular evening meal, especially in the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any available ingredient such as cheese, tuna etc.
All nouns begin with a capital letter for ""you"" at the beginning of a sentence, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is a very important way of distinguishing between some verbs and objects.
It makes reading easier, but writing is a bit of a challenge because you have to determine whether a verb or a noun is the main word.
The Italian pronunciation is relatively simple, since most words are pronounced exactly as written.
The most important letters are c and g, because their pronunciation varies depending on the vowel following them.

If you speak a Romance language, it is obviously easier to learn Portuguese.
People who speak Spanish could, however, be quick to conclude that Portuguese is so similar that it is not necessary to learn it.
Premodern astronomical observatories are no longer in operation and are now used as museums or educational institutions.
As the light pollution during its peak period was not the problem it is today, they are usually found in cities or on university grounds which are easier to reach than the newer buildings which have been built in recent times.
Most modern astronomical observatories are colossal structures in remote areas with favourable atmospheric conditions.
The viewing of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, is a traditional part of Japanese culture.
The concept originated in China, where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first Cherry Blossom Festivals were held by the Emperor for himself and other members of the imperial court in the environs of the imperial palace.
