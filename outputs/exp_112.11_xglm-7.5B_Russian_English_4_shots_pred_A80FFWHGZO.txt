When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives a call and virtually instantaneously reflects it back down.
The satellite was launched by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the atmosphere of Earth distorts our light and view.
To launch a satellite or telescope, you need a giant rocket that is 100 feet tall.

Under them are more cats of medium size, which eat small game from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, many small cats (including roaming domestic cats) eat and hunt on much larger insects, rodents, snakes and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a special work that each cat performs, which keeps it from competition with other.
The lions are the most social cats, living in large groups, which are called prides.
The Pride of the Russian Federation includes one to three adult males, living in the same family, as well as females and offspring, the number of which can reach thirt
The females usually live together in the same family and form a large family of sisters and daughters.

When a small group of living organisms (a small population) separates from the main population from which they originated (for example, if they cross a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment than that in which they were previously.
This new environment has other resources and other competitors, so the new population will need other characteristics or changes compared to those that they had before, to become a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed at all — it still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population adapts to the new environment, it begins to look less and less like the rest of the population.
In time, through thousands of years, these two species will look so different that it will be impossible to say that they are the same species.
We call this process the formation of species, which is the essential and very significant part of evolution.

Cities-states are the precursors of nations. Civilizational culture implies the transmission of knowledge through several generations, a continuous cultural presence and a transferable diffusion.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving any historical evidence, and therefore cannot be recognized as authentic civilizations.
In the American War of Independence thirteen states, in accordance with Articles of Confederation, first formed a weak central government, the only organ of which was the Congress.

For example, the most common format for static photographs is 35 mm, and this was the dominant size of film on the decline of the analog era.
Today it is still produced, but more important is that the ratio of the dimensions of the images of digital cameras inherited.
The 35-mm format is a little confusing, it has a width of 36 mm and a height of 24 mm.
This format is divided into two parts, so the ratio is small in whole numbers. 
Many common formats (e.g. the APS family of formats) are close or equal to these proportions.
Too often used and often mocked rule of thirds is a simple recommendation that creates dynamism, while maintaining a certain degree of order in the image." #

In this period of European history, the Catholic Church, becoming rich and powerful, was the object of intense scrutiny.
Christianity has united Europe for more than a thousand years despite the differences in languages and traditions.
Her omnipresent power touched everyone - from the king to the common man.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to ease suffering and poverty, and that the church's money exists to this purpose.
The center of the church’s authority was based in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth led to the questioning, and is this doctrine being observed?
As soon as hostilities began, Britain set up a naval blockade of Germany.
This strategy has proved its effectiveness, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated all the international laws, laid down in several international agreements over the last two centuries.

In ancient China used a unique way of denoting periods of time; each stage of China or each family in power was a special dynasty.
In addition, there was a period of three dynasties, which lasted for 60 years during the Han and Qin dynasties.
In this period, there had been fierce battles between many noblemen fighting for the throne.
The period of Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting for the throne in a large palace in Xi'an.

The period in which these events took place is called the High Middle Ages, a period of European history that covers the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages replaced the earlier Middle Ages and preceded the later Middle Ages, which, according to the accepted view, ended around 1500.
Technological determinism - is a term, covering a wide spectrum of practical and ideas, from technological progress or technological imperative to strict point of view, that fates of people is driven by the fundamental logic, associated with laws of science
Most of the views on technological determinism share two common ideas: that the direction of technological development is virtually uncontrollable by cultural or political influence and that, in turn, "influence" of technologies on society is determined by their own properties,
For example, it could be said that the automobile is an essential cause of the development of roads.
However, the national road network is economically unprofitable only for a small group of cars, so new methods of production are being developed to reduce the cost of ownership of the car.
Mass ownership of cars also leads to an increase in the number of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new methods of treatment of the injuries received on the road.
Romanticism was largely influenced by cultural determinism, drawn from such writers as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography formed people, and over time, there developed associated with it customs and culture, which, in harmony with the place of residence of this society, were better than arbitrarily imposed
Like Paris is the capital of fashion in the modern world, so Constantinople was the capital of fashion in the times of feudal Europe.
His fame as a center of luxury spread around 400 BC and continued until about 1100 BC.
His status was lowered during the 12th century mainly because of the Crusaders returning with such gifts as silk and spices, which were more valuable than the goods offered on the Byzantine markets.
This is the moment and the transition of the title of the Capital of Fashion from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and the 13th centuries.
At first, clothing was under the strong influence of Byzantine culture on the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the West may lag behind by up to 25-30 years.
Own styles began to develop in Western Europe at the end of the Middle Ages. One of the greatest achievements of that time, thanks to the Crusades, was the use of
Natural agriculture is agriculture that provides enough food for the farmer and his/her family.

Historically, most farmers have been engaged in agriculture for the purpose of sustenance, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded people who feel marginalised by society and allow them to define for themselves who they are.
There are differences between subcultures, due to age, nationality, social status, place of residence and/or gender, from which it consists.
The characteristics that define a subculture as an individual, may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
Some subcultures often claim to be part of a certain style, including through a certain use of style, including through fashion, manners and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to illustrate several tragic cases in which children were not able to contact with adults during their adulthood.

While project-based learning should be simpler and more interesting, flipped learning is ahead of many technologies.
Scaffling is not a method of teaching, but rather a form of support for those who are going through a new experience of learning, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffling can be either virtual or real. In other words, the teacher is a form of scaffling, but also she is the Sticky Note in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding, helping in learning, is embedded in the software and intended to remind, explain and ask questions about procedures, which may be too difficult for the learner to cope with on his own.

In the savanna, the primates with such digestive systems as ours are difficult to meet their nutritional needs by using the available plant resources.
In addition, failure to meet this will lead to such serious consequences as slow growth, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The most accessible plant resources would be proteins found in leaves and legumes, but they are poorly absorbed by such herbivores as we are, if they are
Instead, animal-based food is easy to digest and is rich in proteins, containing all the essential amino acids.
Taking into account all that has been said, it is not surprising that our ancestors decided to "protein problem" approximately the same way that chimpanzees in the savanna are still
Sleep interruption is a process of intentional awakening during the normal sleep and subsequent re-sleeping within a short time (10–60 minutes).
This can be easily done with a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up and yet not completely wake you up.

The use of ships for the transport of goods is, of course, the most effective way of transporting a large number of people and goods across oceans.
Work of seafarers traditionally consists in ensuring the ability of the country to move its people and goods, as well as simultaneously preventing the enemy from moving its people and goods.
One of the most interesting recent examples of this was the Atlantic Ocean during World War II. Americans tried to transport people and materials through the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German naval fleet, using mainly its submarines, tried to stop this movement.
If the Allies had failed, Germany, more than likely, could have won Britain as well as the other European countries.

Domestic goats are usually kept in herds that wandered around the hills or other pastures, over which the herdsmen usually were children or teenagers, which is similar to the more common activity of a shepherd. These methods of grazing are still used today.
The roads for carriages were built in England in the 16th century.
While the wagon roads were merely laid parallel to the logs, they gave horses the opportunity to carry more bulky loads and at a faster rate than on slightly more bumpy roads of the time.
Shovels were used quite a long time to hold rails in place. However, it became clear that the tracks were more effective when laid with a layer of iron above.
This is now the accepted practice, but iron was more likely to wear out wooden wheels on wagons.
Over time, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first rails were made entirely of iron.
The first known form of transport was walking, people began to walk straight two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means the straight man).
For their ancestors, australopithecines, walking straight was not so common.
Bipedal specializations are found in the remains of australopithecines from the period of 4,2–3,9 million years ago, although, perhaps, the sahelanthropus walked on
We can start living, more concerned about the environment. We can become members of the environmental movement and even be activists to at least a little ease the suffering of the future.
Usually, it’s like treating the symptoms. If we need a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problem and fix it.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed greatly due to the scientific and technological progress of mankind, and due to the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of people, the problems
After the Congress of 4 July, a manuscript draft signed by John Hancock and Charles Thompson was sent out in a few quarters to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
In one night, 150–200 copies were made known as "Dante's flyers".
The first public reading of this document was made by John F. Kennedy in the front yard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
On July 6, one copy was sent to George Washington, who 9 July ordered it read before his troops in New York. The copy arrived in London on 10 August.
25 copies of Dantley, known to the present day, are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original hand
Today many paleontologists believe that one of the dinosaur groups survived and lived to this day. We call them birds.
They are often ignored as dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly.
But you can still say a lot about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have claws and clawed feet, they lay eggs and walk on two hind legs as a Tyrannosaurus.
Every computer that is used today is based on the processing of information that is encoded in binary form.
A binary number can have only one of two values, that is, 0 or 1. These numbers are called "binary digits" — or "bits", if you use computer-speak
It may be difficult to diagnose an oral poisoning right away. Such symptoms, such as vomiting, are too general for a quick diagnosis.
The best sign of an internal poisoning is the presence of an open container of medicine or a toxic household chemical.
Read the label, where are given special instructions for first aid in case of poisoning by this specific poison.
The term "bug" is used by entomologists formally to denote a group of insects.
This concept comes from the ancient times bed bugs - insects, well adapted to parasitism on man.
And scavengers, and bed bugs are nest-building species, adapted to live in the nest or home of their owner.
In the United States, approximately 400 thousand cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) are diagnosed each year, making MS the leading neurological disease in the
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, consisting of the brain, spinal cord and the optic nerve.
Studies have shown that from multiple sclerosis suffers twice as many women as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or the best interests of their child.
These couples can choose to create a plan for adoption for their child.
When a child is adopted or a child is adopted by a biological parent, the biological parent refuses to have parental rights for the purpose of allowing another couple to
The main goal of science is to find out how the world is made, by applying the scientific method. This method is the basis of most scientific research." #
He is, however, not the only. Scientific research also follows experimentation (experimentation is a test used to exclude one or more possible hypotheses), asking questions and conducting observations." #
Naturalist and philosophers concentrated their attention on anti-Christian texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
In all scientific matters, including psychology, Aristotle's views were adopted.
As knowledge of Greek language deteriorated, Western civilization was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are largely dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks." #
Periodic rhythms, not just a response to external periodic stimuli, have been recorded by most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to autonomous oscillations for a period of time even without external stimuli." #
The experiment of Hershey and Chase was one of the first hypotheses that DNA is a genetic material.
The Hershey's chocolates with Cheez-Its were implanted with their DNA by phages, i.e. viruses.
They have conducted two experiments, labelling radioactive phosphorus DNA of the phage and radioactive iron DNA of the phage.
Mutations can cause a great number of diverse results depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the mutated segment of the genetic material and whether the mutated cells are embryonic
Only mutations in the germ line can be passed on to the offspring, while mutations somewhere else may lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism is interesting for those who love to travel to the countryside, to enjoy the landscape, including wild animals and plants.
In the list of activities on the site - hunting, fishing, bird watching, photography, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
An example of this is the visit, photography and study of orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave small towns in the countryside to go to work, and by their side pass those whose work is in the place from which they just left.
In this active transport movement, each in one way or another is connected with the system of transport based on personal cars, and supports it.
At present, science indicates that the enormous hydrocarbon economy has influenced one of the stable states of the biosphere, which has supported the evolution of humanity over the past two million years." #
Everyone is a member of society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about these systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear such complaints about the quality of water or falling bridges.
Why do transport systems get so many complaints, why do they fail daily? Is it that transport engineers are incompetent? Or there are more fundamental reasons?
The study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction with each other is carried out within the framework of the study of traffic flows.
It is difficult to study the intensity of traffic, because it is impossible to predict the behavior of the driver with a 100% certainty.
It is fortunate that drivers' behaviour is often quite systematic; thus, traffic flows in general have some systematicity and can be approximated mathematically.
To better understand the transport flow, the relationships between three main variables were established: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relations help in planning, designing and operation of railway facilities.
The insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly helped them to escape from their enemies, find food and partners.
Many insects have the ability to fold their wings along the body, which gives them an advantage.
It provides them with more secluded places, in which they can hide from predators.
Spiders and flies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Sun revolved around the Earth.
Many people thought he was right, but many believed that the Solar System revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars)." #
It seems reasonable, because we don't feel that the Earth is moving, is that not?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the first largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, its width sometimes exceeding six miles.
About 20 percent of the water that enters the oceans from rivers of our planet flows from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is the longest river in the world with a length of 6387 km (3980 miles). It is fed by thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of the Great Pyramids of Giza continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical perfection of the Great Pyramids of Giza

The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world, as well as the smallest population country.
The Vatican uses Italian in legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language of most people working in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Catholics.
People from ancient times were well aware of the basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver and copper, because they can be found in nature in pure form and relatively easily mined with primitive tools.
Philosopher Aristotle believed that everything was made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. It was earth, water, air and fire.
They were like four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although he also conjectured that they would transition into a new state, so that we could see what they were
Smelts are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that in the periodic table there are many elements.
So, such elements as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also make such alloys that contain small amounts of such nonmetallic elements as carbon." #
Everything in the universe consists of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles, called atoms
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them can fit in a point at the end of this
Thus, the pencil became a good friend for many people when it was invented.
It is sad that when new ways of writing were invented, pencil lost its former status and it is less used.
Now people write messages on screens of computers, and they never have to deal with a sharpener.
It is only a guess what will happen to the keyboard, with the advent of more new technologies.
Atomic bombs work on the principle that for the number of protons and neutrons to be in one nucleus, energy is required.
Like to push a heavy cart up a hill. Then the second splitting of the nucleus releases part of this energy
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus which means that they are prone to decay under little or no influence
The Moon's surface consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the cortex is about 70 km under oceans and 100 km under continents.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the mountains.
On the visible side of the moon there are more lunar seas because the crust is thinner there. The waves were easier
Content theories focus on the search for what makes people act or may interest them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that accumulate inside during their development.
The theories concern what makes people want to do what they do, and what makes them do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories about content - the "Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs" and "Gerzberg's Theory of Motivation.
As a rule, can manifest two types of behavior when managers start to lead people, previously equal to them in status. One extreme spectrum - the attempt to remain "his / her own man" (or
Those managers are difficult to take unpopular decisions, disciplinary measures, evaluate the results of work, distribute responsibilities and to punish employees.
On the other end of the spectrum, the individual becomes a non-recognizable individual, who thinks that he must change everything that the team did, and
Because the manager ultimately bears the responsibility for the success or failure of the team.
This kind of behavior very often leads to conflicts between leaders and other members of the team.
Virtual commands follow the same standards of excellence as normal commands, but there are some minor differences.
Virtual members of the team often perform the role of a point of contact for their direct physical group.
They are usually more autonomous than traditional employees, because their teams can meet in different time zones, which can’t always understand local management.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (LaRosa and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also unique component of the virtual team.
The invisible command" is a command that reports to the leaders of each participant. The invisible command sets norms for each participant.

When all available resources are effectively used in all functional units of the organization, creativity and ingenuity may be manifested.
In the end, a united effort of the organization to overcome the obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that will serve the interests of the client
Before an organization can become innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation, exchange of knowledge and accumulation of experience.
Engel (2006) explains the approach "Continuum" as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of effectiveness.
The data of neurobiology give physical evidence for the theoretical approach to study of consciousness. Thus, the field of study narrows, and it becomes much
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior is used by scientists in their studies.
It has long been known that various types of injuries, traumas, lesions and tumors of the brain affect behavior and cause changes in some psychical functions
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and study unseen previously structures and processes of the brain.
This provides us with a large amount of data and materials for creating and simulating models that help us understand the processes occurring in our consciousness.
AI is a very important branch of computer science, which studies the behavior and learning of machines and "infusing" them with intelligence.
Research in the field of AI includes the creation of machines for automation tasks requiring intellectual behavior.
Here are some of the examples that you can cite: control, planning and creating a schedule, response to diagnoses and questions from the customer, as well as recognizing face, hand
These issues are dealt with in separate disciplines, the purpose of which is to solve the problems we encounter in everyday life.
The use of artificial intelligence is often used in economics, medicine, engineering and military fields, being embedded in some software applications for home computers and video games.
Study tours are very important for any class. Often teachers want to take their students there, where it is not possible to reach by bus.
The technology provides a solution by means of virtual tours. Students can visit museum exhibits, visit the aquarium or enjoy the beautiful art sitting with their class.
Uploading your tour to the virtual world for all to see is also a great way to refresh your memory of the tour and share your knowledge with future classes.
For example, each year students at Bennet High School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the capital of their state, and each year that site is updated, but access to the old versions is still preserved — they serve
Blogs can also improve writing skills of students. Although students often start their blog using untidy grammar and spelling, this usually changes due to the presence of an audience.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the author of the blog begins to strive for perfection of his writing in order to avoid criticism.
In addition, students are inspired to be smart and interesting, drawing attention to themselves (Toto, 2004).
Bloggership is an instrument that stimulates cooperation, and it motivates students to spread the process of learning far beyond the traditional academic day.
The proper use of blogs can give students the opportunity to become more analytical and critical. By actively responding to internet materials students can determine their position in the context of other works, as well as to express their own views on specific questions (Oravek, 2002

Stems are the horseman's leg supports, hanging from both sides of the saddle.
They provide the horse with better traction, but they may have safety issues because there is the possibility of a foot getting stuck.
If a horse has dropped the rider, but his foot has stuck in the stirrup, a running horse can drag him along. To minimize this risk, you can take certain precautions.
