This confirms not only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides details that fossils in general cannot provide, such as colour and three-dimensional arrangement.
Researchers say that the feathers of this bird were of a dark brown on top and a lighter brown on the underside.
The Fund also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not possess a well developed sheath called a quill, but other characteristics of feathers — hooks and barbules — the researchers concluded that the quill must have been an evolutionary development later than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or for heart function.
The scientists claimed that this was the tail of a young dinosaur, but the sample showed no feathers.

He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was subsequently charged with murdering her son.
She is in custody until the prosecution and trial, but eyewitness statements could be false as her picture has been widely published.
This is a practice elsewhere in Great Britain, but the Scottish judiciary works differently, and the courts have regarded the publication of photographs as potentially harmful.
Professorin Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee remarks: "Journalists seem to be crossing a dangerous line when they publish photographs and other material of suspects.
The Crown Office has hinted to journalists that at least until the prosecution stage no further comments will be made.
According to a leak, the document refers to the border dispute in which the Palestinians want to return to the status quo before the Six-Day War of 1967.
Other issues, which supposedly have been covered, include the future of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel wants a military presence in the Jordan Valley for ten years from the signing of the agreement, the Palestinian Authority wants a five-year presence only.
The hunters of the accompanying experiment to control the plague should be closely supervised by rangers, as the experiment has been monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited for the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting programme.
Mick O'Flynn, the managing director of Park Conservation and Heritage in the NPWS, said that the four selected hunters had received comprehensive security and training training.
Martelly has just appointed a new Provisional Election Commission (CEP) with nine members.
It is his fifth CEP within four years.
Last month, a Presidential Commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of the package of measures to steer the country in the direction of new elections.
The Commission was the response of the Haitian government to the widespread regime-critical protests that began in October.
The trigger for the violent protests was the fact that the elections scheduled for 2011 have not yet taken place.
There have been over 60 cases of overheating of iPods reported. In total, six fires have been set and four people have suffered minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that it had 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy and Technology announced that it had received 34 additional incidents of overheating from Apple, which it described as "not serious
The Ministry reacted by saying that it was really regrettable that the report had been postponed by Apple.
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 p.m. local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The office for civil protection in the northern Marians said that there were no damages reported in the country.
As well as the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center had said that there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman has taken tourists from Hong Kong as hostages, by kidnapping their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists.
At least six hostages have been rescued and there are at least six confirmed deaths.
Six hostages, including the elderly and children, were released early.
The photographers took the place of an elderly lady when she had to go to the toilet.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and became a medical career.
He became a midwife and took his job at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While he was working in the hospital, Liggins began to study premature contractions." #
His research showed that the application of a hormone accelerated the lung development of the fetus.
Xinhua reported that investigators from the government have recovered two 'black box' flight recorders
Ringer colleagues paid tribute to Luna as well.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of extremes. My first manager. Luna died in the night of the two moons. Very unique, exactly like she. A strong woman.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels gave the following comment: "Luna was just as crazy as me... maybe even crazier... I love her and I will miss her... hopefully she is in a better place.
From the 1,400 people who were questioned in the run-up to the federal elections in 2010, the percentage of those who oppose Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The current acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard has stated during the election campaign for the federal election of 2010, that she believes Australia should eventually become a republic.
34 percent of respondents share this view and want that Elizabeth II. is the last Australian monarch.
29 per cent of those surveyed said Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 per cent of those polled said Australia should never become a republic.
The gold medal winner at the Olympic Games should swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three-person relays at the Commonwealth Games, but because of his many complaints his fitness was doubted.
He was not able to take the necessary medication to relieve his pain, as they are banned at the Commonwealth Games.
On 25 January, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number." #
Many people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software on February 1st and on Tuesday it was announced.
Cosmic comets may have been a source of water for the Earth, together with organic matter that forms proteins and can enable life." #
Cosmic comets collided with the Earth many years ago, and so scientists are hoping to gain insights into how planets, in particular the
Cuomo (53) took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the gossip as "political gossip and silliness.
It is speculated that he may be seeking the presidency in 2016.
NextGen is a system, which the FAA claims would allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology rather than the older technology based on ground radar to enable the air traffic controllers to provide more precise localisation of aircraft and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
There will be no additional transport infrastructure and the underground trains will not stop in Wembley. There are no parking or parking-and-ride facilities available there.
With the fear of transport problems growing, the likelihood that the game would be played without the fans of the team behind closed doors grew.
A study published on Thursday in Science reported the emergence of a new bird species on the Galápagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and at Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species had developed within just two generations, although it had previously been assumed that this process took much longer because of the mating between a native Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant Kaktus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be rolled into a variety of forms. It can be rolled into tiny pieces.
It can be made into a thin wire which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into leaves.
It can be made so thin that it sometimes became a means of decorating handwritten pictures, called picture manuscripts, in books called picture manuscripts.
This is called the PH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator with red vinegar.
The colour of the apple juice changes according to the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemicals.
Hydrogen ions are protons which have been stripped of their electrons (because hydrogen atoms consist
Mix the two powders together and then form them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a protective layer.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had almost every house equipped with a flush toilet, which was connected to a
Wastewater systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia and China there were toilets. In Roman culture toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, which men and women visited in mixed company.
If you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it almost immediately back down.
The satellite was launched by a rocket into space. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and our view.
It is necessary to launch a gigantic rocket with a height of more than 100 feet to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in a way that is unbelievable. The greatest service it has given us is much easier and faster transport.
It brought us the railway, the car and many other means of transport.
In addition to cats of medium size, which eat prey of medium size, from rabbits to elephants and deer, there are also medium-sized rodents.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-roaming domestic cats) that eat far smaller prey animals such as insects, rodents, snakes, lizard
The secret of her success is the concept of the niche, a special task which every cat has and which ensures that she does not compete with other cats.
Lions are the most social cats. They live in large groups, which are called clans.
The herds consist of one to three adult males and up to three females and young.
Women usually have a close relationship with each other when they live in a large family with sisters and daughters.
Lion packs behave like wolf packs or dog packs, animals that resemble lions in behaviour but are not as dangerous to their prey as lions are." #
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (if not particularly well), swim, long distance jump and with the fivefold power of a strong man pull.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar." #
The roar of the tiger does not sound like the confident roar of the lion, but rather like a sentence of gruff, grumbling words.
Ocelot hunters eat small animals. If they can, they will steal monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than he is.
Scientists think that otters track prey (prey) with their sense of smell and find it by sniffing it.
You can see in the dark very well and move unseen. Ocelots hunt their prey by matching their environment and then attacking it.
If a small group of animals (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it comes (for example, if they move over a mountain range or a river or if they migrate to a new island so that they can not easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has other resources and other competitors, so that the new population needs to have different characteristics or adaptations in order to be a strong competitor than what it used to need.
The original population has not changed at all. It still needs the same adaptations as before.
As time goes by, the new population adapts itself to its new environment, and then it looks increasingly like the other population.
After thousands or millions of years, two populations will look so different that they will no longer be considered to be of the same species.
This process is called specialization, which simply means the emergence of new species. It is a natural consequence and an extremely important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe in, and they take carbon dioxide out of the air that people exhale (which is to say, exhale).
Plants produce their food by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses out of plants and make clothing out of plants. We eat mainly plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the largest predator of its time, so it feared nothing but other Mosasaurs.
His long jaws were equipped with more than 70 sharp teeth, including a second set on the tongue, which meant that there was no escape for any animal that crossed his path.
We do not know for sure, but he may have had a hooked tongue. He ate fish, large fish, other Mosasaurs and may even have been a cannibal.
He took everything in, even a great dinosaur like the T. Rex was not big enough for him.
We know a lot about the food that they ate, but they had their share of strange or unusual meals, including wild boar, peacock, snails and a kind of insect called the seven-legged frog.
Another difference was that the poor people ate their food on chairs, while the rich men held banquets where they sat on the side, while they ate their meals.
The Romans could not have food that came from America or Asia in later centuries.
They had no wheat, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no Romans have ever eaten a turkey.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a temple, which was regarded as the house of the god.
They offered sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to comply with the will of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had a public temple and then an inner sanctum, which only priests were permitted to enter.
Often, special pyramidal towers were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East houses did not have such a great significance.
The majority of the Jewish family's life was spent in the open air.
The women cooked in the kitchen. There were simply open shop windows in the street. For the house building stone was used.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so that wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the old Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled for murder. When he travelled further west, he found Greenland and gave it the name Greenland.
But even if he had discovered them, Eskimos had lived in the area long before that.
Although all the countries were 'Nordic', there were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland." #
If you have seen the film 'The Last Legion', you may think that on the reverse of the Declaration of Independence there was a map of treasure.
That is not so. Although on the reverse of the document there is written something, it is not a treasure map.
The declaration of independence was written on the reverse side of the document.
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but it is known that the great scroll (which measures 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up at the beginning of its life to be stored.
It is therefore possible that the mark simply was added as a label.
The landing on D-Day and the subsequent battles freed the North of France, but the South was still not free.
He was controlled by the "Vichy"" Frenchmen. These were Frenchmen who had signed a peace treaty with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders, rather than fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies landed in southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the French liberated the south of France and turned their attention to Germany.
A civilization is a culture that is shared by a significant number of people who live together and work, a society.
The word civilisation comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city state. It also somehow defines the size of a society.
Cities are the forerunners of nations. A civilised culture implies the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint and a proper dissemination.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving any significant historical traces and fail to be recognised as genuine civilisations.
While the revolutions were in progress, the 13 states formed a weak central government, consisting of the Congress.
The Congress was not competent to levy taxes, and there was no national executive or judicial authority, so it relied on the authorities of the states, which often did not cooperate.
He had no authority to suspend tax laws and duties between states.
The articles required unanimous consent of all Member States before they could be changed, and the Member States took the Central Government so little seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world and was the 2006 FIFA World Champion.
Favourite sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 motor racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions and Italians take part in international competitions and Olympic Games.
Japan has nearly 7000 islands (of which Honshu is the largest) and thus Japan is the seventh largest island in the world.
Because of the archipelago/group of islands, Japan is often referred to as an archipelago.
The beginning of Taiwan goes back to the 15th century, when European sailors passed by and recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
1624 the Dutch East India Company establishes a trading post in the southwest of Taiwan, which initiates a change in the cultivation methods of the indigenous peoples and employs Chinese workers on their rice and sugar plantations." #
In 1683, under the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912), the Chinese forces took control of the western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan and declared it a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
The Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War, in which it renounced its sovereignty over Taiwan, which was ruled by Japan until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists mainly of three buildings, namely the Intihuatana, the sun temple and the room of the three windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex were rebuilt to give visitors a better idea of how they looked originally.
The restoration work on Machu Picchu has been going on for thirty years, and it continues to this day.
For example, 35 mm is the most widely used format worldwide, which corresponds to the end of the analog film era.
It is still being made, but it is more important that its image format has been taken over by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
In fact, the 35-mm-format measures 36 mm in width and 24 mm in height.
The ratio of this format (divided by twelve, to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore referred to as 3:2.
Many of the usual formats (the APS format family, for example) have exactly the same or very similar aspect ratio.
The much-maligned and often mocked third rule is a simple directive which creates a dynamic and at the same time keeps order in a picture.
It states that the intersection of the lines that divide a picture vertically and horizontally is the most effective place for the main motif (see example)." #
At this period of European history, the Catholic Church stood on the test.
Since more than a thousand years, Christianity has kept the European states united despite different languages and customs.
His omnipotence ruled over everyone, from the king to the common man.
One of the most important Christian beliefs is that wealth should be used for the relief of suffering and poverty.
The central authority of the church was in Rome for more than a thousand years. This concentration of power and money had led many to doubt whether this principle was upheld.
In the immediate aftermath of the outbreak of fighting, Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective, as it cut off the country from life-saving military and civilian supplies, despite this blockade being contrary to the generally accepted principles of international law, which have been codified in several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from penetrating whole oceanic areas, which was a danger for neutral ships as well.
The response to this tactic was limited, and Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted U-boat warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolation were the dominant attitudes of most citizens and countries.
After the horrors of the First World War, the nations wanted to avoid another such situation in the future.
1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the United States with just four cents in his pocket, with a book of poems and a recommendation letter from Charles Batchelor (his previous employer) to Thomas Edison.
The old China had a unique way of showing different eras. Each era in China and each family in power was a separate dynasty.
The period of the three kingdoms was also divided into periods of unstable dynastic rule. The most famous of these periods was the period of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and the
In these times, there were bitter wars fought by many nobles vying for the throne.
The time of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died in the struggle for the highest throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metrical system, a departure from absolutism towards republicanism and nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a ruler alone.
Also, all professions were open to all male applicants, so that the most ambitious and best could succeed.
The same applies to the military, because the rankings now used were based on the calibre of the weapons.
The French Revolution inspired many oppressed people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed was very interested in things that went beyond the everyday life. He often visited a cave called Hira, which was known as Nur on the mountain of Nur (Light). He would meditate there.
The cave itself has survived the times and offers a lively picture of Mohammed's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It is not easy to find, even if one knows that it exists. Once one is in the cave, one is completely isolated.
You can see nothing but the clear sky above and the numerous surrounding mountains. From the inside of the cave, you can see very little of this world. Or you can hear nothing but the sound of the wind.
The Cheops Pyramid is the only of the seven wonders of the world still standing.
The Cheops Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C. It is one of many great pyramid structures built to honour the dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau or the "Gizeh Necropolis" in Egypt comprises several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples and the Great Sp
The great pyramid was built in honour of the Pharaoh Cheops and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honour of his wives and family members.
The "spread" symbol looks like a V and the "stretch" symbol looks like a square, with the lower line missing.
Up means that you should start at the top and then pull the bow.
The erasing of a word usually produces a softer sound, while erasing a word with a stronger sound is more forceful.
You are free to add your own pencil marks; however, the printed lines are there for musical reasons, so they should be respected.
The terrified King Louis XIV, Queen Marie Antoinette, her two small children (Marie-Thérèse, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4), as well as the sister of the King, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris by a mob of market women on 6 October 1789.
They travelled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a mob of people who threatened the King and the Queen with violence.
The mob forced King and Queen to open their carriages' windows.
Sometime later a member of the angry mob turned his head in front of the shocked Queen's eyes to the corpse of a royal guard killed in Versailles.
The expenditures of the US imperialists in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the US, to cover the bulk of the expenditure, and the interest on the bonds flowed through the banks of Wall Street in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the superprofits that emanated from the continual exploitation of the Filipino people were the fundamental profits of the American imperialist system.
To understand the Templars, one has to understand the context in which they were founded.
The period in which the events took place is generally referred to as the Middle Ages, a period in European history that extends over the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000–1300 A.D.).
The high middle ages preceded the late middle ages, which coincided with the end of the 15th century.
Technological determinism is a term which encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technology push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that the human fate is determined by a pre-existing logic which is linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Many interpretations of the technological determinism share two general ideas. On the one hand, that the development of technology is a process which is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and on the other hand, that technology itself has ‘effects’ on societies which are more intrinsic than socially determined.
It is possible to say that the passenger car is a necessary development of roads.
However, a national road network for only a small number of cars is economically unviable. Consequently, new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The widespread ownership of cars also leads to an increase in road accidents, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques in the health sector to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a strong, cultural deterministic element which was drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography was the key to shaping individuals. Over time, customs and cultures developed with reference to this geography and these, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
So, as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so was Constantinople the fashion capital of the feudal Europe.
His fame as the epicentre of luxury began about 400 B.C. and lasted until about 1100 A. D.
His status declined in the twelfth century, mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices which were regarded as more valuable than the offerings of the Byzantine markets.
At that time, the title of the world's fashion capital was also transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 14th centuries.
At the beginning, the clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantium's culture in the East.
But the styles in the West are 25 to 30 years behind the rest of the world in terms of the slow communication channels.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was the fact that people began to use buttons to fasten their clothing.
Needs management is agriculture that is aimed at producing as many food products as possible to meet the needs of the farmer or the farmer's family.
The subsistence agriculture is a simple, often biological cultivation, which uses saved, in the region's eco-region native seed and uses rotational farming or other relatively simple techniques to maximise the y
In the past, most farmers practised subsistence farming and in many developing countries, that is still the case.
Subcultures bring together people who feel neglected by the social norms and enable them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be differentiated on the basis of age, ethnicity, class, place and/or gender of its members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as such can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual or geographical.
The members of a subculture often signal their membership by a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits and jargon.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialisation is to rely on the few unfortunate cases of children who have not been socialised by adults because of neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse during their childhood.
Those children are called "wild" or "wild". Some wild children have been taken from people and held captive (usually by their own parents); in some cases, however, the neglect of the child was due to the inability of the parents to accept the severe intellectual or physical limitations of the child." #
Wolf cubs may have suffered severe child abuse or suffered traumatic experiences before they were abandoned or escaped.
Others have been raised by animals; some have lived alone in the wild.
If it has been completely raised by animals, the wild child displays behaviours (in the context of his physical capabilities) which almost completely match those of his specific carer, such as his fear or indifference towards people.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the "scaffolding" approach goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support that helps individuals in a new learning situation, such as when they are using a new computer program or when they are starting a new project
Frames can be virtual as well as real. In other words, a teacher is a form of frame, but also the little office-supply-man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual assistance is built into the software and is intended to question, to suggest and to explain the steps that the pupil alone may not be able to complete.
Children are placed in foster homes for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse, exploitation and extortion.
No child should have to grow up in a home environment that is not caring, loving and educationally oriented, but many are forced to do so.
For us, the care home is a piece of security for these children.
Our family care system should provide a safe, loving home, caring parents, a stable education and a reliable health care.
The foster home will cover all the needs that they would not have had in their previous home, if they had not been removed from it." #
The Internet connects both elements of mass communication, as well as interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in respect of the utility- and reward-based approach.
For example, learning and socialisation are cited as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal engagement and sustained relationships were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied the audience reactions to websites.
Video recordings led to important findings for the interpretation of microexpressions, short-lived facial movements.
In particular, it is claimed that one can tell whether someone is lying by deducing the slightest changes in facial expression.
In his article, Oliver Sacks showed how people with a brain injury can still correctly assess the honesty of people.
He even claims that the ability to interpret human behaviour may be shared with animals such as dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation results in new genetic variants and selection removes these from the pool of expressed variants.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with each generation in and out.
Out in the savannah, it is very difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of a human being to meet his nutritional needs from available plant-based sources.
In addition, it has serious consequences if you do not take action: depression, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most accessible plant resources would have been proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for us, unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal food sources (insects, termites, eggs) are easy to digest and provide large quantities of proteins which contain all essential amino acids.
In general, it should not surprise us if our own ancestors had their "protein problem" solved in a similar way as the chimpanzees in the savanna today.
Sleep re-adjustment is the process of target-directed waking during the normal sleep periods and the involuntary inactivity of the body for short periods of time (10-60 minutes) later.
This can be achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without completely waking you up.
If you are someone who imagines the alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room so that you have to leave the bed to turn it off.
Another way of looking at it is to drink a lot of water before going to bed, so that you have to get up to go to the toilet.
The degree of inner calm that a person has is inversely related to the degree of tension in the body and mind.
The less tension there is, the more positive is the potential of the person's life force. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can attain enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way is our own tenseness and negativity.
The Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded to include the path of love of the Mahayana and numerous techniques of the Indian yoga.
In principle, the Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
Kundalini yoga is the awakening of the Kundalini energy (the enlightenment energy) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations." #
The centre of tibetan meditation is the goddess yoga. Through visualisation of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are opened and the
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, which led to a cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war, the clash of systems, the course and culture of the countries led to the fact that they fought each other.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
He should last for the next 40 years and be carried out in the real world by proxy armies in Africa, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defence had already collapsed and the only hope lay in a retreat and a reorganisation along the Romanian bridgehead.
The plans were, however, almost obsolete overnight when 800,000 Red Army soldiers of the Soviet Union invaded the white-ruled and Ukrainian fronts and created these after they had invaded the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the agreements signed by the Soviet Union with Poland, the non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Poland, and other bilateral and
The use of ships for the transport of goods is the most efficient means of transporting large amounts of people and goods over the seas.
The task of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that a country is able to carry people and goods and at the same time to hinder the enemy's ability to do so.
One of the most significant recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans tried to bring workers and material to the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic mainly by submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to take Britain exactly as the rest of Europe.
It is thought that goats were domesticated in the Zagros Mountains in Iran around 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and peoples began to keep them as livestock to get easily at their milk, fur, skin and meat.
Sheep were usually kept in herds, which wandered on hills or other pasture areas. The cattle were looked after by cattle herdsmen, very similar to the more well-known shepherds; often were these children or adolescents. These
In England, in the 16th century, people built embankments to support the railways.
Although the railway tracks consisted of only parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to move faster and carry heavier loads than on the rougher roads of the time.
As early as the beginning of the 20th century, it was recognized that railways carrying a railway track were more efficient than railways carrying a railway track alone.
This was customary, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron railway was introduced.
The first known mode of transport was walking. Man began walking about two million years ago with the appearance of the Homo erectus (which means "standing man").
Your predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk as regularly.
Two-footed species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3,9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have been walking on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate future suffering a little.
This is in many cases just a symptomatic treatment. If you want to deal with the root of the problem, then you should find a solution and treat it.
It is plainly obvious that the world has changed due to the scientific and technological advances of mankind and that the problems caused by overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles of people have become more serious.
After his adoption by the Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by the Congress president John Hancock and the secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to the printer John Dunlap.
In the course of the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as "Dunlap broadsides.
The first reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the Independence Hall on 8 July.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops on July 9 in New York.
The 25 Dunlap broadsheets that are still extant are the oldest still extant copies of the document. The original handwriting has not survived the
Many paleontologists now believe that there is a group of dinosaurs that have survived and are still alive today. They are called birds.
Many see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and fly.
But many things about birds still look like dinosaurs.
You have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and run on both hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
Almost all computers today are based on the processing of information in binary form.
A binary number can only have one of two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, to use the computer jargon.
A poisoning can be detected only after a period of time. The symptoms, for example vomiting, are so general that it is not immediately possible to make a diagnosis.
The best evidence for a poisoning by ingestion is the presence of an open container of medicines or toxic household chemicals.
Look at the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison.
The term 'wade' is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this insect group.
This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs. These insects are very adaptable to parasitizing humans.
So both bedbugs and fleas are nidicol, which means that they adapt to their nests or their hosts' homes.
In the United States of America there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which is the most common neurological disease among adults aged between 20 and 40 years.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and the peripheral nerves.
Studies have shown that the risk of getting MS is twice as high in women as in men.
A couple can decide that it is not in their own interest or in the interest of their child to raise a baby.
These couples can choose an adoption plan for their baby.
When a child is adopted, the biological parents give up their parental rights, so that another couple can take on parental responsibilities.
The main aim of science is to discover how the world works. This method is in fact the basis of most scientific investigations.
But it is not only about experimentation, where an experiment is a test which is intended to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses.
Natural scientists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts and in particular on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were widely accepted.
With the loss of Greek language skills, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behaviour are often the result of the presence of body-specific cycles and their production by biological clocks.
A cycle of behaviours that are not only responses to external cycles, but are known in most living things, even in bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that even in the absence of external signals continue to oscillate in free-swinging cycles.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the most significant evidences that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacteria.
They took two experiments into account, in which either the DNA of the phage was marked with radioactive phosphor or a protein in the phage was marked with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, whether it is a germline mutation, whether it is a somatic mutation, and whether it is a cell that is involved in germline development.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cancer or death.
Nature-based tourism draws people to visit areas of natural beauty, including wild plants and animals.
Exemples of activities on the ground are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
An example of this is the visit, the photographing and the studying of orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave small provincial towns with their cars to go to their workplace and are passed by others whose workplace is the place they just left.
In this dynamic traffic, all are in some way connected to a transport system based on private cars, and support it.
Now, unfortunately, this massive carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has been the human evolution in the last two million years.
Everyone takes part in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries you will rarely hear complaints about the quality of the water or the collapse of bridges as much as you will in developing countries.
Why do transport systems fail so often? Why are transport engineers incompetent? Or is something fundamentally wrong going on here?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
It is a pity that studying traffic flows is difficult, because one cannot predict driver behaviour with a hundred percent certainty.
Thankfully, drivers tend to behave reasonably consistently; therefore, flows of traffic have a certain stability and can be represented mathematically in a
To better represent the flow of traffic, the relationships between the three main characteristics have been defined: (1) river, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of facilities on the road.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the sky. Their ability to fly helped them to evade enemies more easily and to find more efficient food and mates.
Most insects can fold their wings along their bodies.
They have a wider range of small holes in which they can hide themselves from predators.
Today, butterflies and moths are the only insects that can fly with their wings folded.
In the ancient world, a man named Aristarch claimed that the sun was at the centre of the movements of the solar system.
Many people thought he was right, but many others believed the opposite: that the solar system including the sun and even the other stars were moving around the earth.
It seems reasonable, because it does not seem to you that the earth moves?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the most water-rich river in the world. It flows more than eight times as much water as the second largest
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, with a width of up to six miles.
 Twenty percent of the water that flows through rivers on the planet is from the Amazon.
The Amazon main river is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It takes water from thousands of smaller rivers into it.
Although the construction of pyramids from stone until the end of the Old Kingdom continued, the Pyramids of Gizeh in their size and the technical perfection of their construction were never surpassed.
Egyptians in the ancient New Kingdom admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were thousands of years old at the time.
The Vatican City has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the smallest population country in the world.
Vatican City uses Italian for its legislative and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language of most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known to mankind for thousands of years, since these can be found in their original form in nature and are easily extracted with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, posited the theory that all things are made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements. It was earth, water, air and fire.
This corresponded more to the four states of aggregation (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma. He also posited the theory that they would change into new substances to form what we see.
Aluminium is a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are regarded as metals. Of course there are other metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys which contain very small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
The universe is made up of matter in its entirety. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that billions of them would fit in the end of this sentence.
So, therefore, the pencil was invented by many people to be a good friend to them.
Unfortunately, the pencil has been pushed into the background by the introduction of new writing methods, so that it has been marginalised in its status and in its use
People write messages on computer screens without ever having to get close to a rocket launcher.
We should be very curious to see what will come out of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The atomic bomb is based on the principle that energy is required to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like if you roll a heavy car up a hill. If the core is split, some of this energy will be released.
Some atoms have unstable cores, which means that they can break down even at the slightest provocation.
The surface of the moon consists of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The outer layer is about 70 km thick on the near side and about 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the sea and thicker under the highlands.
On the near side, there could be more Maria, since the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
These theories focus on what people are interested in, or what they are moved by.
The theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or wishes that are acquired during their adulthood.
The theories deal with what certain people do in order to want exactly the things they want, and what influences in their environment cause them to want to do or not to do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
There are two possible behaviours when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the boys" (or one of the girls).
This kind of manager has problems in making unpopular decisions, to carry out disciplinary measures, to carry out performance appraisals, to assign responsibility and to impose responsibility.
At the other end of the spectrum one becomes an unrecognizable individual who has to do everything differently than the team has done and takes everything into his own hands.
Finally, the team leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behaviour often leads to friction between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are led by the same high standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members have often the function of a contact point for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, since their teams may meet in different time zones which may not be taken into account by the local management.
The presence of a truly invisible team (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also an unique component of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the leadership team that reports to each member. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.x
Why would an organisation undertake the time-consuming process of introducing an organisational learning concept? A goal for the practical implementation of organisational learning concepts is innovation.
If all available resources are used efficiently across all departments of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can arise.
In the end, the joint work of an organisation on overcoming an obstacle can lead to a new innovative procedure that takes into account the customer's needs.
Before an organisation can be innovative, the leadership must develop a culture of innovation and shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the concept of the continuum as a method to help organisations become more efficient.
Neuroscientific data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. This limits the research field and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research.
It is well known that various types of brain damage, such as trauma, injuries and tumours, can influence the behaviour and cause changes in some brain functions.
New technologies enable us to see certain brain structures and processes for the first time.
This provides us with many information and material to build simulation models that will help us understand the processes in our heads.
KI is strongly associated with science fiction, but it is a very important branch of computer science that deals with behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
The field of artificial intelligence encompasses the production of machines that require intelligent behaviour.
Exemples of this are control, the setting of strategies and timetables, the ability to answer customer questions, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become autonomous disciplines, which are focused on finding solutions to problems of the real world.
The computer system is now used in many areas of industry, medicine, engineering and military, and is also incorporated into many software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are an essential part of every school. Often a teacher would like to take her pupils to places where a bus journey is not possible.
Virtual tours are a technical solution. Pupils can view museum objects from their classrooms, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful art works.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and to share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design and build a website each year about their trip to the capital of the state. The website is updated each year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a collection album.
Blogs can also help improve the writing skills of students. Although students at the beginning of their blog experience often have a sloppy grammar and spelling, this usually changes as a result of a readership.
Students are often very critical audiences, so the blogger tries to improve his writing style to avoid criticism.
The blogging forces the students to learn more about the world around them. The need to attract the attention of the public inspires the students to write intelligently and interestingly (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires cooperation and encourages schoolchildren to continue their learning outside the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can help students to become more analytical and critical; by responding to Internet material, students can define their own positions in the context of texts by others and present their own perspectives on particular topics.
Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital of Canada and is home to a number of art galleries and museums that present Canada's past and present
In the south are the Niagara Falls, and in the north spreads the untouched beauty of nature in Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and other things make Ontario unique as what is considered typical of Canada by outsiders.
A large area further north is sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that many surprises: There are more African Americans in the US than Canadian citizens have.
The islands in the Indian Ocean off the African coast are located.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, in terms of animal life, a separate continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or attached to France and are known as luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to the islands and it was very successful there.
The European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
In the North, the region is delimited by the Sahel zone and in the South and West by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travellers should make a declaration of marital status, irrespective of their actual marital status.
But wearing a ring is helpful (don't wear a ring that looks too expensive.
Women should recognise that cultural differences can lead to what they perceive as an assault, and that it is not uncommon to be followed, bound, etc.
Keep your consistency when you reject men, and don't be afraid to defend your position (cultural differences aside; that does not mean that it is okay!)
Today's Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century before the beginning of time, and was used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Merinides as a strategic port with the
The Portuguese destroyed them and rebuilt them under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon them after a earthquake in 1755.
The Ottoman Sultan built the city as Dar el Beida again and it was called Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places where traditional Moroccan goods such as Tagines, pottery, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of tinned food are sold, but that is all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the extreme east near Rwanda.
In 2002 the city of Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city, especially the city centre.
While Goma is relatively safe, it is important to plan your stay outside Goma carefully, in order to know the situation in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of the Nyiragongo volcano as well as for some of the cheapest gorilla tracking tours in Africa.
You can use Bodabodas (motorbike taxis) to get around Goma. The usual fare is ~500 Congolese francs for a short
This in combination with its relative remoteness has made "Timbuktu" a metaphor for exotic, faraway countries.
Although Timbuktu is a tourist attraction and has a airport, it is today a poor city.
In 1990, the threat of sand dunes was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger.
It was one of the most important stops on the PBS special "Africa’s Wonders" by Louis Gates.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the cities of the country, for it is more of an Arab than an African feel.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the north-eastern corner of South Africa. It borders in the east with Mozambique, in the north with Zimbabwe and in
The park has an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecosystems, each of which supports a different animal species.
He is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is regarded as the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As all South African national parks, the park charges daily entry fees.
It may also be worth buying a wild card, which grants access either to selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the namesake of the territory of Hong Kong and is the focus of many tourists.
The buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline were compared with a shimmering bar chart that is visible through the presence of the waters of the Victoria Harbour.
For the best prospects for Hong Kong, you should leave the island and travel to the opposite side of Kowloon.
The majority of the city-building of Hong Kong Island is concentrated along the newly acquired land along the north coast.
This is the place that the British colonists have taken over. If you want to find traces of the colonial past of the area, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forest belt in the world and extend over 80 km from the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland to the coast.
The Sundarbans were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not only mangrove swamps – they also encompass some of the last remaining remnants of the mighty jungle which once covered the Ganges
The Sundarbans stretch over an area of 3,850 km2, of which a third is covered by water and marshes.
The Sundarbans are a nature reserve since 1966, and according to estimates, there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and up to 30,000 spotted deer there.
Buses run all day long from the district-wide bus station (on the other side of the river) and, apart from the buses heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30 a.m
In this way, it is advisable to buy a ticket in advance.
The majority of districts are by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
Taxi-hailing services are a fast and convenient way to get to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a curved cable bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges
Your two towers are 83 metres high, their height is 378 metres and they have two lanes with 3,50 m width.
The bridge height is 15 metres. The construction work was completed in August 2011 and the opening for traffic took place in March 2017.
The bridge will be operational by September 2017. It is expected that the Brazilian customs checkpoints will be completed by then.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group that inhabited the present-day Paraguayan eastern region. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters
The Chaco region was also the home of other indigenous groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering and
Paraguay was formerly known as the 'Grande Província de West Indies', which was the result of the Spanish conquest of the native Indian
The Spaniards began the colonization period, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for its polo team and its players being among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place at Las Cañitas Polo fields in December.
(DE) Kleinere Turniere und Wettkämpfe können hier auch zu anderen Zeiten im Jahr angeschaut werden.
Informations on polo competitions and duty-free sales points for polo tickets can be found at the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is set in accordance with the value of the British Pound
Money can be exchanged in the only bank on the island, which is located opposite the FIC West Store.
The pound is generally accepted everywhere on the islands and at Stanley credit cards. Also, US dollars are often accepted.
On the remote islands credit cards will probably not be accepted, although British and American currency can be accepted; ask the owners in advance which payment method is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland Islands' currency outside the islands themselves, so you should exchange your money before you leave the island.
But Montevideo is located south of the equator, so it is there in summer when it is in the northern hemisphere winter.
Montevideo is in the tropics. In the summer months, temperatures can reach over 30°C.
The winter can be misleadingly cold: the temperatures rarely fall below freezing point, but wind and humidity lead to a feeling of colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct wet or dry seasons: The amount of rainfall remains about the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to the sight of humans, they are still wild animals and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the instructions of the park authority, visitors should keep at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals.
Even if Bisons, Wapitis, Elche, Bears and all the big animals look peaceful, it can still happen that they turn on each other.
Every year, thousands of visitors are injured because they do not take enough care. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so leave them plenty of room.
Be aware that odours attract bears and other wild animals. Avoid carrying strong-smelling food with you or cooking it, and be careful to keep your camp clean.
Apia is the capital of the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 18th century and is the capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a shameful stalemate in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
Only one British ship was lost. Almost 200 Americans and Germans died.
While the Mau movement was organising the independence struggle, a peaceful meeting in the city led to the killing of the chief of the Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III
There are many beaches in Auckland. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore lie on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Most of the beaches are sandy with safe bathing facilities and most offer shade from Pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located at the harbour of Waitemata, in the upper suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central
There are also family beaches, which are sometimes overcrowded, with a beautiful promenade along the coast. Swimming here is safe.
The most important local beer is "Number One". It is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is "Manta".
There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines are probably better tolerated.
Local tap water can be safely consumed, but if you are concerned, you will also find bottled water.
For Australians, the idea of coffee is ""flat white"" foreign. A small black coffee is ""espresso"" and a cappuccino is filled with foam (not with milk) and tea is served without
The hot chocolate is Belgian standard. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many trips to the reef take place all through the year and injuries caused by any of these causes on the reef are rare.
However, you should follow the Council of authorities, all signs and especially pay attention to security warnings.
Shellfish, which are common in the vicinity of beaches and in the vicinity of river mouths, occur in the north of 1770 from October to April.
Sharks exist, but they are rarely harmed by humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would run away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live in the sea, their primary habitat is in river mouths north of Rockhampton.
A reservation in advance gives the traveller the assurance that he will have a place to stay when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although you may also book other accommodation, such as camping sites, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies usually offer packages in which breakfast, transport to and from the airport or even a combination of flight and hotel are included.
You may also reserve your seat for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain further documents for your destination (for example, a visa).
Any changes or requests should, however, be made first to the travel agency and not directly to the hotel.
Many festivalgoers decide to camp out at the festival and most visitors believe this to be an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you have to get there early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that there will be music playing on parts of the festival until very late at night, even though the main concerts have finished.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the North Sea in winter, check the state of the cabin, as breaking through ice can be quite horrendous for the most affected.
Cruise ships also offer the opportunity to visit the city. Passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos generally try to keep their guests as long as possible and to spend as much money as possible. There are usually no windows or watches, and exits are sometimes difficult to find.
You usually have a special offer for food, drinks and entertainment to keep the guests happy and to ensure that they stay.
Some casinos offer alcoholic beverages free of charge. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good players know how important it is to remain sober." #
Anyone who wants to travel in high latitudes or over mountain passes should be prepared for snow, ice and temperatures below freezing.
On icy and snowy roads, the liability is low and you can't drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
In very short time, so much snow can fall that you can get stuck.
The visibility can also be impaired by falling snow or by condensation or ice on the windows.
On the other hand, cold and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and the traffic runs all year round largely uninterrupted.
Safaris are probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
Safari is a term used in everyday language to describe a trip to see the overwhelming African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars, and the standard equipment enables a good view.
Lion, leopard and cheetah are often shy and you can observe them better with a telescope.
A bushwalk is a walk which lasts for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will take place at other venues in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Olympic Summer Games, having already hosted the 1964 Games.
If you have booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the rescheduling was announced, you could end up in a difficult situation.
The cancellation policies vary, but from mid-March most cancellation policies did not apply until July 2020, for the Olympic Games that were planned.
It is estimated that most tickets will cost between 2500¥ and 130,000¥, a typical ticket will cost about 7000¥.
Washing your clothes can help drying them. Many hotels provide irons and ironing boards, even if you are not present in the room.
If there is no iron available or you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer if one is available.
Be careful that the substance does not get too hot (it can shrink it or lead to fires in extreme cases).
There are various methods for cleaning water. Some of them are more effective than others to deal with certain threats.
In some areas, it is enough to boil water for a minute, in others it may be several minutes.
Filters vary greatly in effectiveness, and if you have any doubts, then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers can encounter animal pests that they do not know from their home regions.
Infestation can destroy food, cause irritation or even provoke allergic reactions, give poison or transmit diseases.
Infections as such or dangerous animals that can cause injury or death to people are usually not classified as vermin.
Tax-free shopping is the possibility to buy goods at certain places which are exempt from customs duties and taxes.
Travellers who have a destination country with a high tax rate can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, particularly in the case of alcoholic beverages and to
The section between Point Marion and Fairmount on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway is the most challenging driving section, as it often leads through remote, undeveloped countryside.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: steep gradients, narrow roads and sharp turns are prevalent here.
The speed limits specified here are noticeably lower than in the previous and following sections - usually between 35 and 40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict compliance with them is even more important than usual.
However, interestingly, the mobile coverage here is much better than in many other areas of the route, for example, the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German bread is delicious. In Bavaria, it is rich and varied, as well as in Austria.
Sweetbread is widespread, with apples being cooked all year round and plums and pears being used in summer.
Many German cakes also contain nuts, almonds or other nuts. Popular cakes often go particularly well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want to produce small, but rich baked goods, then try this, which is called in different regions Berliner, pancakes or crepes.
A curry is a dish that is based on herbs and spices, with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either dry or wet depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is usually used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is used
With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a catch-all term that encompasses a great variety of regional cuisines that can be found throughout the country
The term is used without any further attributes, and usually refers to the food that originated in the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine, which is now widely spread throughout the archipelago, offers a variety of simple spiced dishes. As flavouring agents the Javans prefer nuts, chilis, sugar (especially javan coconut sugar) and a number of aromatic spice
Stitching is a kind of aid for the feet of the riders, which hang down from both sides of the saddle.
They give the horse more stability, but there are security concerns because the feet of the horse may get caught in them.
If a rider falls off his horse and hooks his foot on the stirrup, he can be pulled along if the horse passes. To minimise this risk, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
First of all, most horses wear shoes with a flat sole and a smooth, narrow heel.
In addition, some saddles, in particular English saddles, have safety buckles which allow a saddle to fall when it is pulled back by a falling rider.
The Cochamó Valley – Chile’s most important climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a number of large granite walls and cliffs.
The summits offer a spectacular view. Climbers from all over the world discover new routes along the walls, which offer endless possibilities.
Skiing and snowboarding are popular sports, in which skis or snowboards are attached to your feet and you descend a slope on a snow covered surface.
Skiing is a popular pastime with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as'ski-penners', who plan their entire holiday around the skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depicting skiers go back to 5000 BC!
The origins of skiing as a sport go back at least to the 17th century and in 1861 the first ski club in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Skitouring with a backpack: This activity is also known as ski touring or ski walking.
It resembles alpine skiing or mountaineering, but it does not necessarily entail it, since it is carried out in steep terrain and requires much firmer ski
Look at the ski route as a comparable hiking route.
When you are in good health, you can cover greater distances than you would on a skiing holiday - only very rarely will you reach the speed of a skiing holiday without a heavy pack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has numerous independent countries. Normally you would have to apply for multiple visas and go through multiple passport controls if you want to travel through several countries.
The Schengen area works in this respect somewhat like a country.
As long as you remain in this zone, you can usually cross the border without having to go through the passport control again.
In other words, you do not have to apply for a Schengen visa for each of the Schengen states individually, which saves time, money and bureaucracy
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique. Some tax authorities define over 100 years old goods as antiquities.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be lower in regions such as North America.
Handmade products could be described as 'antique', although they are younger than similar products produced in mass production.
The reindeer breeding industry is a major source of Sámi subsistence, and the culture around the trade is also of great importance for many who work in other professions.
In the past, not all Sámi have bred large numbers of reindeer, but have lived mainly from fishing, hunting and other activities. They kept reindeer mainly as draught animals.
Today, many Sámi work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
The term ""gypsies"" is often used by non-Roma as a derogatory term, since it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma.
If a travel warning is issued for a country you are visiting, your travel insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also consult the advice of other governments as your own. Their advice is aimed at their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may be confronted with other situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Conferences are merely a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views expressed are often superficial, general and, in comparison to the more detailed information that can be found elsewhere, too simplistic.
Flooding is the umbrella term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, social disruption or loss of life.
Floods can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of floods, which depend on geography, topography and the atmosphere.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall and forest fires are forms and effects of weather, as are storms, tornados, waterspouts
Regional and seasonal weather phenomena are, for example, blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be on the lookout for any type of weather that affects their area, as this will have a negative impact on all travel
Everyone planning to travel to a country that is considered a war zone should have a professional training in order to be able to cope with the situation.
A search for ""course on hostile environments"" will probably show the address of a local company.
A course covers the whole range of problems discussed here usually much more comprehensively, usually in combination with practical experience.
A course is usually between 2 and 5 days long and includes role-playing, much first aid and sometimes weapons training.
There are numerous books and journals on survival in the wilderness, but few on war zones.
Travellers planning to have a gender-switching operation abroad must ensure that they have valid ID documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with a non-specified gender (X) or documents that have been updated to reflect the desired name and gender, is different.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognise these documents varies greatly.
The searches at security checks have become more intrusive since 11 September 2001.
Transgender people should not expect that their privacy and dignity will be respected when passing through the scanners.
Riss currents are the return current of broken waves, often at reefs or similar.
Because of the underwater topography, the flow in a few deeper areas and a fast current can form there.
The majority of deaths occur as a result of exhaustion trying to swim against the current, which can prove impossible.
If one is able to get out of the current, it is not difficult to get back into it.
If you are trying to get somewhere, try to get somewhere where you are not caught. Alternatively, if you are noticed, perhaps you should wait for rescue.
The shock of return is earlier than the shock of culture shock (the honeymoon phase is not as pronounced), lasts longer and is more serious.
Travellers who were able to adapt easily to the new culture find it sometimes particularly difficult to adapt to their own culture.
When you come back from a foreign study abroad, you have adapted to a different culture and have abandoned some of the behaviours of your home culture.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding because they knew that travellers had to adapt to a new country.
I am not sure that returning travellers are expected to show patience and understanding.
The sound and light show at the pyramids is one of the most interesting attractions for children in the area.
You can see the Pyramids in the darkness and while it is still quiet before the show begins.
Normally you hear the sounds of tourists and shopkeepers. The story of the sounds and the light is like a story book.
The Sphinx is used as a background and narrator of a long history.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids, with the different pyramids being examined.
The Southern Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most stations. In 2020 there were sixteen active.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Another island is Livingston Island and Deception, where the still active caldera of a still active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbour.
Ellseworthland is the region south of the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula rise here and then divide the 360 km long chain of Ellsworth Mountains, which is divided into two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak is the Mount Vinson, at 4892 m.
In remote areas without mobile coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is not a substitute for a mobile phone, because you have to be in clear sight of a satellite to make a call.
The service is often used by ships, including pleasure ships, as well as expeditions that require data and voice links.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide further information about the connection to this service.
An increasingly popular option for people planning to take a year off is study and course offerings abroad.
This is particularly popular among university graduates, as it allows them to take a year off before university without affecting their studies.
In many cases, participation in a transnational mobility programme can actually improve your chances of getting a university education in your home country.
In most cases, a fee is charged for registration to these programmes.
Finland is a great destination for boat tours. The "land of the thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands - in the lakes and in the archipelago
For the archipelagoes and lakes, you do not necessarily need a boat.
In addition, even though the coastal island groups and the largest lakes are actually large enough for every boat, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience." #
Boating is the national pastime in Finland, one in six or eight owns a boat.
This is, however, comparable to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the ratio is one for fourty
Most purely Baltic cruises include a longer stay in St Petersburg in Russia.
That means that you can visit the historic city for a whole day, while you return home and stay overnight on the ship.
If you only go on a tour of the countryside, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Many cruises offer Berlin as a destination in Germany. You can see that Berlin is far from the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of a cruise.
Travelling by air can be a terrifying experience for people of any age and from any life-stage, especially if they have never flown or have had a traumatic experience behind them.
It is not shameful: It is nothing else than the personal fears and antipathies that many people have.
To learn more about the workings of aircraft and the processes involved during a flight can help some to overcome their fear of the unknown or the feeling that they have no control.
Courier companies are paid well for the quick delivery of things. Often, time is a very important factor in business documents, trade goods or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the larger firms use their own aircraft, but on other routes and at smaller firms there have been difficulties.
If they sent things via air freight, the loading and customs clearance could take several days on some routes.
The only way to get it done faster was to send it as a baggage." The airline regulations do not allow you to send luggage without a passenger, and that’s where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first class is to put a substantial amount of money on the line (or, better still, to convince your own company to pay for it).
That is not cheap: as a rough guide you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business and first class for economy class!
It is pointless to look for discounts on direct flights from A to B, even if you are looking for business or first class seats.
The airlines know very well that there is a certain group of passengers who are prepared to pay a lot of money to get to their destination as quickly as possible, and they demand appropriate prices.
The capital of Moldova is Kishinev. The native language is Romanian, but many people also speak Russian.
Moldova is a multiethnic state, which has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognised by any member state of the United Nations.
Despite the failure of the political negotiations, economic relations between these two parts of the Republic of Moldova have been restored.
The most important religion in Moldova is the Christian Orthodox.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest harbour after Istanbul and a very good transport hub.
The once ancient city of Smyrna is today a modern, progressive and prosperous business centre, located at a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass buildings and modern shopping centres are shaped by classic red tiled roofs, the market from the 18th century, as well as old mosques and churches, although the city is more characterised by a Mediterranean atmosphere than that of traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík has a unique octagonal church.
There are some interesting marble sculptures of birds on some graves.
It is worth walking through the fascinating village.
In the north and close to it is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which has been known to foreigners after Lord Byron described its beauty in vivid colours.
The Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly from Cabo da Roca to Sintra.
Visit also the great shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (Faithful Shrine) in the north, a place which is world famous for its Marian apparitions.
Please bear in mind that you are actually visiting a mass grave and a place of immense importance for a substantial proportion of the world population.
There are still many men and women who have survived here, and many more with their relatives who have been murdered or worked to death there, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat this site with the respect, the reverence and the dignity that it deserves. Don't make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Don't vandalise the site by painting or scratching graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer Catalan, the majority understand it, and almost everyone can speak Spanish.
Most of the signs are, however, only in Catalan, as it is the official language of the country.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other public services.
Normal announcements are made in the Metro exclusively in Catalan, but unforeseen disturbances are reported by an automated system in a variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are said to be egocentric, rude and arrogant.
Although this is often only a misleading stereotype, one finds oneself in Paris much better off if one behaves like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-bred). This will make it easier to get along.
The rough exterior of Paris disappears very quickly when you put down the basic manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, there are mainly oak, fir and pine trees and it offers a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
He has a remarkable diversity of microclimates, different soils and different altitudes, which makes it possible to have a remarkable diversity of plant communities.
The area is also home to a very large diversity of animal and bird species.
There are rare species of fauna such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, foxes, wild cats and hens, as well as many more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts that reach to the knees and they must cover their shoulders.
In most monasteries there are no diapers for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially a brightly coloured one, the monk or nun at the gate will smile at you.
In addition, men should wear trousers that reach below the knees.
And these can be borrowed from the stock, but the clothes are not washed after each user, so you may not feel comfortable in these shirts." For men there is a standard size!
The mallorcan cuisine is based, as in similar areas of the Mediterranean, on bread, vegetables and meat (particularly pork) and uses always olive oil.
A simple and popular evening meal is the Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any available ingredient such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is a very important way of distinguishing between some verbs and objects.
It makes writing easier, but it is a little bit difficult, because you have to decide whether a verb or a noun is used as the main word.
The Italian pronunciation is relatively simple, since most of the words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the vowel following them.
Also, pay attention to the difference between r and rr: caro means ""love"" whereas carro means ""carriage"".
Persian has a relatively simple and regular grammar.
Because you will be able to read this introduction to Persian grammar, you will learn a lot about Persian grammar and you will
If you speak a Romance language, it is easier to learn Portuguese.
People who speak Spanish might be quick to conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it is not necessary to learn it.
Ancient observatories are not in operation any more and are used as museums or educational centres.
Given that light pollution during its peak period did not pose a problem that it does today, they are usually found in cities or on university grounds that are easier to reach than those built in recent times.
Most modern astronomical observatories are enormous structures in remote regions with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Hanami is a traditional Japanese custom that dates back to the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first Cherry Blossom Festivals were held by the Emperor for himself and other members of the imperial court, and only for themselves
Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove just one.
If you go to a formally laid out garden and collect samples, you will also be thrown out without discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to live in, and once you arrive you can almost buy anything.
You are located in the extremes of the tropics and only a few degrees north of the equator, so you must be both exposed to heat (always) and strong sun (rarely).
There are also a few buses that go northwards to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives
Make sure that the bus you are travelling on goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kirjat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good basis for planning a holiday.
For example, visits to castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or a cruise along the Erie Canal or a boat trip along the Danube or the Rhi
They are also popular cycling and walking routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is regarded as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with Christmas were adopted by non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries.
There is a tradition to spend the night of Easter in some open place to see the sunrise.
Of course there are Christian-theological explanations for this tradition, but it could also be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
Traditional churches often hold a midnight vigil on Easter Sunday, when the celebrations of the community begin at midnight, when the resurrection of Christ is celebrated.
All animals that came originally to the islands came either by swimming, flying or by sinking here.
Because of their great distance from the continent, mammals were not able to travel, which made the giant tortoise the main grazing animal on the Galapagos Islands.
From the first people to visit the Galapagos Islands, many animals have been introduced, including goats, horses, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise over the horizon.
This gives us a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky is usually dark all the time.
The sparsely populated areas and the light pollution are not a problem, so you can also enjoy the starry sky.
The Japanese work culture is hierarchical and formal than what Westerners might be used to.
Coats are a common business attire and colleagues use their family names or job titles.
The harmony at work is of paramount importance, with the focus being on the group effort rather than individual achievement.
Often, employees have to ask for the consent of their superiors for all decisions they take, and it is expected of them that they will follow the orders of their bosses without question.
