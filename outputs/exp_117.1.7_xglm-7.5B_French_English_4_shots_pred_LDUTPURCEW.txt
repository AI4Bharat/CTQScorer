The American Gymnastics Federation supports the letter of the United States Olympic Committee and accepts the absolute necessity of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.

It confirms not only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but provides details that the fossils cannot usually provide, such as colour and three-dimensional arrangement.
The scientists say that this bird's feathers were brown-tan on top and pale or carotenoïde on the bottom.
This discovery also allows us to better understand the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a fully developed root, which is called a tail, but show other features that are typical of feathers – bristles and barbules – the researchers concluded that the tail was probably an evolutionary development later on.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight but rather for regulation or display of temperature.
The scientists say that this is certainly the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, but the sample reveals a feather belonging to an adult, not a juvenile.

The accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the police commissioner, said that the accused had been covered up when they appeared before the court.
The three people were present when the car crashed into the house, but none were injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured to the head.
The road where the accident took place was temporarily closed to allow rescue services to extract the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrookes Hospital in Cambridge.
 Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son by the Sheriff Court of Edinburgh.
She is in custody awaiting her trial, but eyewitness testimony could be compromised because her portrait has been widely disseminated.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but the Scottish courts operate differently and have considered that publishing photographs could be potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, of Dundee University, notes that'journalists seem to be following a dangerous line if they publish photographs, etc. of suspects'.
The Crown Prosecution Service has said that no further comment will be made at least until the prosecution is brought.
According to the leak, the document will deal with the dispute at the border that the Palestinians claim on the basis of the existing borders before the Middle East war of 1967.
The other subjects discussed include the future State of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel requires a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of ten years from the signing of an agreement, whereas the Palestinian Authority is prepared to grant a period of five years.
The shooters of the additional parasite test were closely monitored by rangers, as the test was controlled and its effectiveness was evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) inc., qualified volunteers were recruited, in the context of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting programme.
Mick O'Flynn, the temporary conservation manager for the NPWS, said that four shooters were chosen for the first aerial shooting campaign.
Martelly has just appointed a new provisional Electoral Council (CEP) comprising nine members. 
It is the fifth PEC of Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee recommended the dissolution of the previous CEP in the context of a set of measures aimed at engaging the country on a new path towards elections.
This committee was the response of Martelly to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The violent protests sometimes took place because of the absence of elections, which were due to take place in 2011.
About 60 iPods overheating cases have been reported, resulting in six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had received 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, the METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which it had described as 'non-serious'.
The Ministry of Finance has reacted by calling it'really regrettable' that the report has been postponed.
The earthquake struck the Mariannes at 7:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The Emergency Management Agency of the Northern Mariana Islands has stated that no damage has been reported in this country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre has said there is no sign of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has taken hostages in Manila, the Philippines' capital.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
At least six hostages have been rescued, and the death of at least six of them has been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released prematurely, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took over the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and went into medicine.
He followed a training course in obstetrics, and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When he was working at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature births during his spare time. 
His research has shown that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the pulmonary maturation of the baby.
Xinhua reported that the government investigators recovered two flight data recorders (black boxes) on Wednesday.
Other fighters also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: 'Luna was the first Queen of the extreme. My first manager. Luna died on two moons. A unique moment, like her. A strong woman.'
Dustin 'Goldust' Runnels commented that 'Luna was as strange as me... or even more... I love her and I'll miss her... I hope she rests in a better place.'
A survey conducted among 1,400 people before federal elections in 2010 revealed that the number of opponents to the transformation of Australia into a republic had increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the federal election campaign that she thought Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 % of those polled share this view, and wish that Queen Elizabeth II is the last monarch to rule Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 % of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 % believe Australia should never become a republic.
The gold medallist was expected to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical condition was questioned.
He could not take the necessary medicines to overcome his pain, these being banned within the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest known prime number to date.
Many people have checked the discovery using different equipment and software in February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Cosmic comets may have been a source of water for the earth, as well as organic matter which can form proteins and promote life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, and particularly how the Earth was formed, because comets have collided with it for a long time.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, 53, began his term in office in January and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He described the rumours as 'babble and political nonsense'.
We think he will be the next President.
According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that would allow aircraft to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, reducing carbon emissions.
It is based on satellite technology, and not on ground-based radar systems used previously, which allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more detailed information.
The additional transport is non-existent and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking and relay stations are not available on the ground.
The fear of not having enough transport has led to the possibility that the match could be played in closed doors, without the fans of the teams.
A study published today in Science has reported the emergence of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands.
A researcher at Princeton University in the United States and at Uppsala University in Sweden have indicated that the new species had evolved in only two generations, although this process had been estimated much longer, due to the reproductive interbreeding between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the finch immigrant with conical beak, Geospiza conirostris." #
You can shape gold in many ways. It can be rolled into small pieces.
It can be twisted thin, which can be bent and twisted. It can be hammered or laminated into sheets.
It can be made very fine, and glued onto another metal. It can be so fine that it has sometimes been used to decorate hand-painted images in manuscripts called "enlumined manuscripts.
That's what we call a chemical product pH. You can make an indicator by using red cabbage juice.
The colour of broccoli changes according to the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the chemical tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electron (because hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron)." #
Mix the dry powders together, then, with clean hands and moist ones, press them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will produce a strange sensation and produce a sort of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets equipped with a flush system in almost all houses, connected to a sophisticated sewa
Found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, were pipes systems.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, in Persia and China. In Roman times, public baths sometimes included toilets for men and women.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite receives the call in space, then returns it to Earth almost instantly.
The satellite was launched by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts a part of our light and our vision.
We need a giant rocket of more than 30 meters in height to put a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in many ways. The greatest benefit it has brought us is to have made transport much simpler and faster.
It has brought us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Below are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, including rabbits, deer and other cattle.
In addition, there are many small cats (including free-roaming cats) that eat the smaller prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a special task assigned to each feline, thereby preventing it from competing with other felines.
The lions are the most sociable cats, living in large groups called packs.
The packs are composed of one to three adult males, as well as thirty females and cubs.
Women are generally very close to each other, their families being made up of a large number of sisters and daughters.
The lions act as packs of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in their behaviour, and also very deadly for their prey.
Balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (but sometimes difficultly), swim, jump great distances and pull with five times the strength of a powerful human.
The tiger is part of the same family (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones capable of roaring.
The roar of the tiger does not sound like the roar of the lion, but rather like a phrase whose words would be cries and groans.
The ocelot is fond of small animals. It catches monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if it can. Almost all animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than him.
According to scientists, ocelots hunt and find prey (prey) by smelling their tracks on the ground.
They see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision, and they move about very stealthily. The ocelots hunt their prey by blending into their environment before they leap on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it is derived (for example, if it moves over a mountain range or river, or if it moves to a new island so that it cannot easily return to the mainland), it often finds itself in a different environment than it was previously.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so that the new population will need new characteristics or adaptations to be a powerful competitor against what it had previously needed.
The population of origin has not changed at all, it still needs the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they will no longer be considered to belong to the same species.
We call this process'speciation', which simply means the formation of new species. It is an inevitable and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, expire).
Plants produce their food by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses and our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The giant squid was the superpredator of the time, it did not fear anything, except other giant squid.
His long, razor-sharp jaws were equipped with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, as well as a series of teeth in the palate, so that anything that crossed his path could not escape.
We are not sure, but it may have been a bit of a tongue-twister. His diet included turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been cannibal.
He also attacked everything that was in water; even a dinosaur like a T. rex was not big enough against him.
While the Romans ate food that we know, they ate strange or unusual dishes, including pigs, chickens, cockroaches and snails, as well as the hare, a sort of rodent.
Another difference: while the poor and the woman ate their food sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to organise banquets where they rested on the side while they ate their meals.
The Roman meals of antiquity could not include these foods from the United States or Asia which have been introduced into Europe centuries later.
For example, they did not have wheat, tomatoes, or potatoes, or cacao, and no Roman never tasted pork.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a main temple which was considered to be the dwelling of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to answer the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivities.
Each temple had a courtyard, then a inner sanctum to which only priests could access.
Sometimes, the pyramids were built as part of a temple.
The summit of the tower was a sacred place for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the home was not so important.
The bulk of the Jewish family’s life was spent in the open air.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were only open counters giving on the street. Houses were built in stones. 
As there were no great forests in Canaan, the wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In Scandinavian sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder that he found Greenland — and named it — on his travels further west.
But, apart from its discovery, the Eskimos of the time lived there.
While each country is'scandinavian', there are many differences between the people, the kings, the customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie Benjamin Gates and the Templar Treasure, you may well think that a treasure map has been drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence. 
But that is not true. Although there is an inscription on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, it read 'Original Declaration of Independence dated 4 July 1776'. The text is on the bottom of the document, reversed.
While no one knows who wrote it, it is known that at an early stage of its existence, the great scroll (which measures approximately 29 inches three quarters on 24 inches) was rolled up. 
It is therefore likely that the rating was added simply as an indication.
The landing day and the subsequent battles freed the north of France, but the south was still not free.
She was ruled by French collaborators, French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupying power instead of facing it.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies landed in southern France, an invasion called Operation "Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French Forces had liberated the south of France and were heading for Germany.
A civilisation is a unique culture shared by a large number of people who live and work in cooperation, a society.
The word 'civilisation' derives from the Latin word 'civis', which means civil and is related to the Latin words 'civis', which means citizen, and 'civitas', which means city or state and which also indicates, in a way, the size of the society to which it relates.
Cities-states are the pioneers of nations. A civilisational culture involves the transmission of knowledge on several generations, a durable cultural empreinte and a fair distribution.
Minority cultures are often lost without leaving any historically relevant traces and are not recognised as genuine civilisations.
In the revolutionary war, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government under Articles of the Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes and, as there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on the authorities of the State, often less cooperative, to enforce all its acts.
He did not have the power to derogate from tax laws or from customs duties between Member States.
The articles required unanimous consent of all the Member States before they could be amended and Member States took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, with Germany's national team, the second most successful team in the world and they have won the World Cup in 2006.
In popular sports, football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, equestrian sports, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 are included.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, Italians participating in international and Olympic events.
Japan has about 7 000 islands, which makes it the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the group of islands that it comprises, Japan is often referred to, from a geographical point of view, as an 'archipelago'.
The first information concerning Taiwan date back to the 15th century, while European sailors passing through the area referred to it as Ilha Formosa, or 'beautiful island'.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the south-west of Taiwan, introducing a transformation of traditional practices of rice production and employing Chinese labourers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared it a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the first Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Treaty, by which it ceded Taiwan to Japan, which was then ruling the island until 1945.
The Inca citadel is made up of three main structures: the Intihuatana, the sun temple and the three-window room.
Most of the neighbouring buildings have been rebuilt to give tourists a better view of their original appearance.
In 1976, 30 per cent of Machu Picchu had been restored and this restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format of photographic film is 35 mm; it was the most common format of film used at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still made today, but what is important is that its image format is inherited from the format of the digital camera sensors.
The 35 mm format is in fact, and it is quite surprising, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
So it is said that the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by 12 to obtain the simplest of integer ratios) is 3:2.
A number of common formats (APS, for example) are equal to this aspect ratio or are close to it.
The third-party rule is a simple directive which is being abused and ridiculed, but which is a dynamic and effective instrument.
He says that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the vertical and horizontal lines dividing the image.
(IT) During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was being questioned.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has bound Europe together despite the differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power touched everyone, from the king to the peasants.
One of the most important Christian principles is that wealth should be used to relieve suffering and poverty, and that the church's money is there specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church was in Rome for more than 1000 years and this concentration of power and money has led many people to ask whether this doctrine was respected.
After the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain established a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategy has proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade has been in violation of internationally accepted and codified law by several international treaties of the last two centuries.
The United Kingdom is destroying international waters to prevent ships from venturing into entire areas of international waters, which represents a threat even for neutral ships.
As this tactic did not elicit a timid reaction, Germany expected a similar reaction in its submarine warfare without limits.
In the 20th century, most citizens and nations showed a preference for pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of the War during the First World War, the nations wished to avoid such a situation recurring in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four hundred dollars in his name, a poetry book and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his previous employer) to Thomas Edison.
The ancient Chinese had a unique way of showing the different periods of China or each family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
There were also periods of instability between dynasties, such as the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty.
In these periods, fierce battles have been fought between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms were one of the bloodiest periods in Chinese history. Thousands of people died in battle to sit on the throne of the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political repercussions such as the use of the metric system, the passing of absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people and not to one single leader.
As well, after the Revolution, the professions were opened to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and the most talented to succeed.
It is the same for the army, because the ranking of armies is no longer based on class, but on calibre.
The French Revolution also inspired many other working-classes in other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions that transcended the worldly life. He used to frequent a cave which became famous under the name of 'Hira' on the mountain of 'Noor' (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived to the time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find, even if we know that it exists. When we entered the cave, we were completely isolated. 
Over there, you can't see anything else but clear skies and beautiful mountains surrounding it. From the inside of the cave, you can't see or hear anything else from this universe.
The Great Pyramid of Gizeh is the only one of the seven wonders that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid of Egypt was built by the Egyptians during the third millennium BC.
The Giza plateau, or 'Giza necropolis', in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, contains several pyramids (the largest being the most imposing), several small tombs, many temples and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built to honour the pharaoh Khéops, and many small pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honour his wives and family.
The symbol 'push' looks like a V and the symbol 'pull' looks like a staple or a square with a missing side.
The top means you must start with the tip and push the bow, and the bottom means you must start with the arrow and pull the bow.
A bow upwards produces a softer sound, while a bow downwards produces a stronger and more assertive sound.
Don't hesitate to write your own marks on the pencil, but remember that the musical pencil marks are for a musical reason, and that you should generally respect them.
On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, his wife, Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old), and the sister of the King, Madame Elisabeth, all terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles
In a carriage, they were returning to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and screamed threats against the king and the queen.
The king and the queen were forced to open the windows of their carriages because of the crowd.
At some point, a crowd member brandished the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles before the terrified queen.
The US imperialist war expenditures in the Philippines have been paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay colonial US taxes to cover a large part of the expenses and interest payments on the Philippine government bonds issued by Wall Street banks.
Of course, the superprofits derived from prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people could constitute the fundamental benefits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we need to understand the context in which they were founded.
These events took place during the period generally considered to be the High Middle Ages – the period of European history from 1000 to 1300.
The Middle Ages Central preceded the High Middle Ages and followed by the Low Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from the technological push or the imperative to a strict sense of the term, according to which the destiny of humanity is dictated by a logical underpinning linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technological developments.
Many interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: technological development itself is a process that transcends cultural and political influences, and technology has an impact on societies that are intrinsically conditioned rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that the car is a necessary factor in the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a few cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Massive car ownership also leads to a greater incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the field of health care for treating body injuries.
Romanticism presented an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
Romantic theories say that geography has shaped individuals and, over time, customs and a culture linked to this geography would have emerged. These, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris is known as the capital of the world’s fashionable contemporary, Constantinople was considered as the capital of the European feudal.
His reputation as the centre of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until 1100 AD.
His status has declined over the twelfth century, mainly because the Crusaders had brought back presents such as silk and spices, which the Byzantine markets could not compete with.
It was at this time that the title of the capital of fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic architecture reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries.
At the beginning, the dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture, to the east.
However, due to the slowness of communication methods, Western modes could be behind by 25 to 30 years.
In the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time, following the Crusades, was the use of buttons for closing clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is a form of agriculture practised solely for the purpose of providing enough food for the farmer and his family.
A subsistence agriculture system is a simple system, often biological, using preserved seeds from the region, combined with rotational or other simple techniques to maximise yield.
Historically, most farmers practised subsistence farming and it is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals feeling neglected by the social norms and sharing the same ideas which enables them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnic origin, class, location and / or sex of members.
Cultural criteria that determine a subculture as distinct from the mainstream can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of these criteria.
The members of a subculture often signal their membership by a distinctive and symbolic style, which encompasses modes, maniérismes and slang.
One of the most common ways of illustrating the importance of socialisation is to draw on a few unfortunate cases of children who, by negligence, misfortune or deliberate abuse, have not been socialised by adults during their childhood.
Those children are considered to be "wild" or "savage". Some wild children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents) ; in some cases, the abandonment of this child was due to the rejection by parents of a severe intellectual or physical disability that the child suffered.
Wild children may have suffered serious abuse or trauma before being abandoned or escaping.
Others would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in the wild.
When they are raised entirely by non-human species, wild children display almost the same behaviours as those of the species that raised them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
As the project-based learning should make learning more easy and more interesting, the support goes further.
Support is not a learning method but rather a means of helping learners who discover a new teaching method such as the introduction of a new programme or the start of a new project.
Supports can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but the little Microsoft Office guy is also one.
Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are intended to guide, explain and guide students through procedures that might have been too difficult to manage by an individual.
Children are placed in foster care for very diverse reasons which include neglect, exploitation, extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, attentive and educational, but that is the case.
We perceive family placement as a safe zone for these children.
Our family placement system is supposed to provide safe, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable healthcare.
Placement in family homes is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they had been previously removed.
Internet combines mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approach to usages and gratifications.
For example, 'learning' and'socialization' are seen as major factors promoting the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and continuing relationships were also identified as being new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied the public reactions to Internet sites.
Video recording has led to great discoveries in the interpretation of facial expressions, i.e. facial expressions during a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect if a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, has described how people with brain damage are able to assess the sincerity of the speech with precision.
He suggests that such human behavioural interpretation abilities may be found in domestic dogs.
Research conducted in the twentieth century has shown that there are two genetic reservoirs: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and the selection removes it from the reserve of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination alternate between the two main watersheds at each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet its nutritional needs from the available plant resources.
In addition, a lack of response has serious consequences: growth disturbances, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult to digest for us, unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal feed (ants, termites, eggs) is easy to digest and provides a large amount of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
Well considered, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors have solved their 'protein problem' in a similar way that chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentional waking during your sleep and the subsequent relaxation after (from 10 to 60 minutes).
It can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock, so that you can wake up without waking up completely.
If you get stuck resetting your clock at night, it can be placed on the other side of the room, making it impossible for you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other possibilities based on the biorhythm include drinking a lot of liquids before going to bed (especially water or tea, reputed to be diuretics), which forces you to wake up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace of a person opposes the degree of tension in his or her body and mind.
When the tension is low, the present vitality is positive. Each person has the opportunity to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been enriched by the path of mahayana and by many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, the Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the universal love path.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (illumination energy) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
Tibetan meditation centre is the yoga of the deity. It is through visualising different deities that the channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War 11, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. At the end of the war, deep conflicts between their different systems, methods and cultures led to the end of the entente between these two countries.
Two years after the end of the Cold War, old allies have become enemies and the Cold War has begun.
It would last for the next 40 years and see real conflicts, through replacement armies, on battlefields in Africa as well as Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and elsewhere.
On September 17, 1939, Polish defence was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
But these plans have become obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800 000 Red Army soldiers arrived and created the Bieloruss-Ukrainian front after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, as well as other international treaties, bilateral or multilateral, that they are bilateral or multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and goods across oceans.
The work of the armed forces has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the capacity to move your people and your goods, while interfering with your enemy's capacity to move his people and his goods.
Another recent example of this situation is the North Atlantic campaign during the Second World War. The Americans tried to cross the Atlantic Ocean to help the British.
At the same time, German naval forces, using mainly U-boats, were trying to stop this trade.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as it did for the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were domesticated for the first time around 10, 000 years ago in the Zagros mountains in Iran.
Cultures and ancient tribes began to keep them close to them so that they could easily access milk, fur, skins, and meat.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that wandered on hills or other pastures, often cared for by herders who were most often children or adolescents, known as'sheep-herders'. These pastoral methods have always existed today.
The 'wagonways' were built in England in the 16th century.
While the railway tracks were simply made of parallel planks of wood, they allowed horses to reach greater speeds and to carry heavier loads than on the slightly more accident-prone roads of the day.
The cross-ties were introduced early enough to keep the runways in place. However, it was soon apparent that the runways would be more effective if they were provided with a steel plate on top.
It has become a common practice, but the iron has caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron wheels were introduced.
The first means of locomotion was walking: humans began to walk upright about two million years ago with the arrival of the Homo Erectus ("right-handed man").
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, walked on all fours.
There are bipedal specializations in fossils of Australopithecus from 4,2 to 3,9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs already seven million years ago.
We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even campaign to alleviate the sufferings to come.
In many cases, it is a symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not just want a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems and disable them.
It is clear that the world has changed thanks to the scientific and technological achievements of mankind, and that the problems have become more important because of overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of mankind.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a draft manuscript signed by the Congressman John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to a few blocks away, to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
At night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, today known as "Dunlap Broadsides.
The public reading of the document was held in the Independence Hall on 8 July.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 sheets Dunlap that we know of still exist are the oldest copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many palaeontologists now believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive. They are called birds.
Nobody thinks of them as dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly.
But there are still a lot of birds that look like a dinosaur.
They have scales on their feet and claws, they lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like T-Rex.
In practice, all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information which are coded in binary form.
A binary number can only have one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary numbers, or bits for using the computer jargon.
An internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are sufficiently general to allow a diagnosis to be made without delay.
The best indicator of an internal poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of toxic household chemicals.
Look at the label to find out the first aid instructions specific to this poison.
The term 'insect' is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from an old familiarity with bed bugs, which are very adapted to parasitise humans.
The flies, like bed bugs, are nidicolous, that is to say, they are adapted to live in the nest or the host's home.
In the United States, there are approximately 400 000 known cases of MS, making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
The multiple sclerosis is a central nervous system disease that affects the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have MS than men.
A couple can very well estimate that it is not in their interest, nor in the child's interest, to take care of the education of a baby.
They can choose to adopt a baby.
In adoption, biological parents end their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main objective of science is to understand how the world works through scientific method. This method guides in fact most scientific research.
It is not the only one, experimentation, and an experiment is a test which serves to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, to pose questions and make observations, but which also orients the scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers have concentrated on ancient texts, and in particular on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's opinions on all scientific questions, including psychology, have been accepted.
With the decline of Greek knowledge, the West has been cut off from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behaviour are often dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external stimuli, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
The biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to operate in a certain period even when there is no external stimulus.
The experience of Hershey and Chase was one of the main indications that DNA was a living matter.
Hershey and Chase used viruses or phages to implant their own DNA into a bacteria.
They have conducted two experiments to mark the DNA of the phage with a radioactive phosphorus, or the protein of the phage with a radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the extent of the mutated material, and whether the mutated cells are germ cells.
Only germline mutations can be passed on to children, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism is aimed at those who wish to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, in particular the fauna and flora.
Hunting, fishing, bird watching, photography, park visits and studying the ecosystem are examples of activities on the spot.
You can, for example, go and see, photograph and discover the orang-utans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small towns of countryside by car to go to their place of work and cross other people who are going to work in the country they have just left.
Dynamic passenger transport system, each is in some way connected to a vehicle-based transport system and supports it.
The science now shows that this massively carbon-based economy has pushed the biosphere out of its stable state that has supported human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they fail to work every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flows are the study of the movements of drivers and vehicles between two points, and of the interactions they exercise between themselves.
It is difficult to study the flow of traffic because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with 100 % certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act in a reasonable range; so, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically approximatively.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) the flow, (2) the density and (3) the speed.
These relationships help to plan, design and operate road infrastructures.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly allowed them to escape more easily from their enemies and to find more effectively food and companions.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their bodies.
It gives them a greater number of small hideouts from predators.
Today, only dragonflies and ephemerals can fold their wings.
There are some, 000 years ago, a man called Aristarchus said that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but many thought the opposite: that the solar system moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
It seems reasonable, because the Earth does not feel the slightest movement, is it not?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times the volume of water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the largest river in the world, reaching sometimes 10 km wide.
At least 20% of the water that falls from rivers on the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main branch of the Amazon River is 6 387 km (3 980 miles). It collects the water of thousands of small rivers.
While the construction of pyramids continued up to the end of the Ancient Empire, the Great Pyramid of Gizeh never surpassed its size and the technical excellence of its construction.
Ancient Egyptians were enchanted by the monuments of their predecessors, who had then been building them for more than a thousand years.
Vatican City has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and the least populated.
The Vatican City drafts its legislation and its official communications in Italian.
Italian is also the language of everyday use by most of the people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
The citizens of the City of Rome are all Catholics.
From antiquity, people have been familiar with basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, because they are found in nature as raw materials and are quite simple to mine using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, has theorised that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. It was earth, water, air and fire.
It was rather the four states of matter (in the same order) : solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although he also expressed the theory that these latter would transform into new substances to form what we see.
Aluminium alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered as metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain a small amount of non-metal elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of minuscule particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that billions of them could enter the period at the end of this sentence.
So, a pencil was a good friend for many people when it was released.
Unfortunately, the appearance of new writing styles has marginalized the pen to a more private status and has been used less often.
People now write their messages on computers screens without ever having to get near a pencil.
It is only fair to wonder what the keyboard will become when the next new thing comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it combines a nucleus of a myriad of protons and neutrons.
Like if you were to make a hill climb by dragging a heavy cart up a hill.
Some atoms have a highly unstable nucleus, so they tend to break up with little or no pressure.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust. Its outer layer is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the visible side and 100 km on the hidden side.
It is finer at sea and thicker under the continents.
There may be more lava on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centred on the search for what makes people feel good or attracted.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they matured into adulthood.
These theories examine what drives some people to want what they do and what drives them to do or not do certain things in their environment.
Two popular theories are the Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and the two-factor theory of Herzberg.
Generally speaking, two behaviours can emerge when a manager becomes the boss of former colleagues. From one extreme being to try to stay 'the good friend' (or 'the good friend's').
This type of manager is not able to take unpopular decisions, carry out disciplinary actions, carry out evaluations, and delegate responsibilities, and hold others responsible.
On the other side of the spectrum, one becomes a hideous individual who feels that he/she must change everything that the group has created up to now and do things his/her way.
After all, the boss is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behaviour often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same high standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical team.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet at different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a real "invisible" team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also an unique element of a virtual team.
The 'invisible team' is the team of management that each member reports to. It sets the standards for each of them.
Why would an organisation want to create a learning organisation? One of the objectives of implementing organisational learning concepts is innovation.
When all the available resources are used efficiently in the functioning of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can be expressed fully.
In other words, the process of working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
Before an organisation is innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and its own culture of learning.
Angel (2006) describes the Continuum approach as a method used to help organisations achieve better results.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. They thus allow for a reduction in the scope of research and make it much more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research.
We know for a long time that different types of damage, lesions, tumours and brain trauma affect behaviour and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The development of new technologies has enabled us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
It gives us a lot of information and material to build models of simulation that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although Artificial Intelligence is often strongly connoted as science-fiction, it is an important part of computer science which studies the behaviour, learning and adaptability of intelligent machines.
Artificial intelligence research is aimed at automating tasks requiring an intelligent approach.
In addition to the examples mentioned above, there are the control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to customer needs, recognition of writing, voice and face.
This practice has led to distinct disciplines, oriented towards providing solutions to everyday problems.
The artificial intelligence system is now increasingly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and military, as it was put into practice in several home computer software and video games.
Excursions are integral to any school. Often, a teacher would like to take his students to places where a bus journey is not possible.
The solution is provided by virtual educational outings. Pupils can view the ancient objects of a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a beautiful work of art while sitting with their class.
Participating practically to a trip is also a good way to reflect on a trip and to share your experiences with future generations.
For example, students at Bennett High School in North Carolina create a website each year dedicated to their visit to the capital of the state. Each year, the website is updated, but the old versions are kept online for archival purposes.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Even if students often try blogging with poor grammar and spelling, the fact that they have a public makes it more likely that the situation will improve.
As students are often the most critical of the blog, the author is trying to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging "forces students to better understand the world around them" and "encourages students to be intelligent and interesting." The need to stimulate public interest encourages students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are an effective tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning well beyond the traditional school day.
Blogs can also help students to strengthen their analytical and critical thinking skills: by responding actively to online content, they can confront their own opinions with those of others and expose their own views on specific topics.
Ottawa is the charming capital bilingual of Canada and has a large number of art galleries and museums that highlight the past and present of Canada.
You will find further south the falls of Niagara and further north, the Muskoka region and its environs which possess a virgin natural beauty.
All these measures, and many more, make Ontario what foreigners regard as the quintessence of Canada.
A large part of the northern regions are not very populated and some are almost uninhabited in the wild.
For a comparison of the population that is more than a surprise to some: There are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The islands of the East African coast lie in the Indian Ocean, close to the African coast.
Madagascar is by far the largest country, and even a continent to itself, in terms of wildlife.
Most of the small islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known for being luxury beach resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam into the lands and this religion has spread widely to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route linking Europe to India.
North, the region is defined by the Sahara Desert, and to the south and east by the Atlantic Ocean.
To women: It is recommended that any woman who travels say that she is married, irrespective of her marital status.
It is also recommended to wear a wedding ring (which should not appear too precious.
Women must realise that certain cultural differences may lead to behaviours they regard as harassment. It is common that they are followed, caught by the arm, etc.
Be firm in your refusal of advances, and do not be afraid to hold your ground (cultural or not, it does not mean that it is acceptable!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and the Merovingians as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese, who after it had been destroyed had rebuilt it and named it Casa Branca, abandoned it in 1755 after a quake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city under the name of Daru l-Badya, and it was renamed Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco for buying.
Around the old medina, you can easily find traditional Moroccan products, such as tajines, pottery, leather goods, and all sorts of handicrafts, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of Nyiragongo volcano which buried most of the city's streets, in particular the city centre.
Although Goma is reasonably secure, any visit to the outside of Goma must be subject to checks to understand the state of the fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of Nyiragongo volcano as well as for tracking gorillas in the most affordable of Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motor taxi) to get around in Goma. The normal (local) price is around FRF 500 for a small trip.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, 'Tombouctou' has become a metaphor for distant and exotic countries.
Today, Tombouctou is a poor city, although its reputation as a tourist attraction has made it a popular destination, and it has a small airport.
In 1990, it was added to the world heritage list in danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main steps in the series 'African Wonders' on the PBS.
The city contrasts strongly with the rest of the country, because it has a style more Arab than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the border south is the Crocodile River." #
The total area of the park is 19 500 km2, divided into 14 ecozones, each of which contains a specific fauna.
This is one of the most famous South African National Parks and regarded as the jewel in the SANParks crown.
As for all South African national parks, there are daily entry and conservation fees.
It may be advantageous to obtain a Wild Card which enables you to visit certain South African national parks, as well as all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the name of the territory of Hong Kong and represents the main centre of interest for many tourists.
The row of buildings that forms the horizon of Hong Kong was compared to a shimmering bar chart, which is revealed by reflection in the Victoria harbour.
To admire the most beautiful views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to Kowloon's seafront located in front.
The majority of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the northern side of the harbour.
This is the place that the British colonists have invested. Thus, it seems to be a good starting point if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this region.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest mangrove forest belt, extending for 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the back-country of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a world heritage site by UNESCO. The part of the forest located on Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not only made up of mangrove swamps: they also contain some of the last vestiges of the majestic jungles which covered the vast plains of the Ganges in the past.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3 850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water/wetlands.
Sundarbans is a natural reserve since 1966, you will find approximately 400 Bengal tigers and 30 000 spotted deer there.
The buses leave the district bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, but most, especially those that serve the east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6 and 7 a.m.
Inter-district buses are often full, so it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese ships, which are comfortable and robust.
The shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to get to places close by, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock Bridge is a suspension bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to link the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint George in Guyana.
The two towers stand at a height of 83 metres; they are 378 metres long and have two 3 m wide lanes.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. The structure was completed in August 2011, but it was opened to traffic only in March 2017.
The bridge should be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs control posts should be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group living in what is now the eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also practising subsistence agriculture.
Other tribes of indigenous peoples who populated the Chaco, such as the Guaycurú or the Payaguá, survived mainly by fishing, hunting, or gathering.
In 1516, Paraguay was born from the meeting between the Spanish conquerors and the indigenous peoples.
The Spanish began the period of colonisation, which lasted three centuries.
From the foundation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve a large part of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best teams and among the best players in polo in the world.
The biggest polo tournament of the year takes place in December at Las Cañitas polo fields.
In addition, smaller tournaments and matches are sometimes organised here at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and venues where you can buy tickets for polo matches, please visit the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Isle of Man is the Manx Pound (FKP), which is equivalent to a pound sterling (GBP)." #
Money can be exchanged at the sole bank in Stanley, opposite the FIC West shop.
The pound sterling is a widely accepted currency in the islands, while in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the nearby islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, even if it is possible that British and American dollars will be accepted. Talk to the owners in advance to agree on a payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange money from the Maldives outside the islands, so change it before you leave the islands.
Montevideo being located south of the Equator, the winter in the northern hemisphere corresponds to the summer there and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical zone and summer temperatures are often in excess of 30°C.
Winter can be misleadingly cold: temperatures rarely fall below zero, but wind and humidity combine to give the impression that it is colder than what the thermometer says.
There is no real 'rainy' and 'dry' seasons: rainfall is pretty constant all year round.
While many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, they are wild animals; please do not feed them or disturb them.
According to the park authorities, it is necessary to stay at least 100 metres away from wolves and bears and at least 25 metres away from all other wild animals!
As they may appear to be so docile, the bison, elk, reindeer, bear and almost all the great animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they have not kept a sufficient distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them some space.
In addition, know that odours attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid transporting or cooking odours-prone foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of about 40 000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and is the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a tragic naval stalemate in 1889, when seven German, American and British ships refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
The Supreme Head Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was assassinated during a peaceful gathering in the city, during the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement.
The beaches are numerous, for Auckland is on the border of two ports. The most popular ones are found in three zones.
The North Shore beaches are on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay north to Devonport south.
Most of the beaches are sandy and allow safe swimming, and most are shaded by the Pohutukawa.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the chic Mission Bay and Saint Heliers district of Auckland.
The beaches, sometimes very frequented by families, have many shops along the coast. Swimming is safe there.
The local beer is the 'Number One', a rather ordinary beer, but tasty and refreshing. There is also another local beer, the 'Manta'.
There are many French wines to taste, but New Zealand and Australia wines may travel better.
You can drink local tap water without any risk, but you can easily find bottled water if you have any concerns about it.
For Australians, the idea of a 'coffee cream' is foreign. A black coffee is an 'espresso', a cappuccino is filled with cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is Belgian standard. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many voyages on the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries caused by one of these causes on the reef are rare.
However, follow the advice of authorities, obey all signs and pay careful attention to safety warnings.
From October to April, the box jellyfish arrive near beaches and estuaries of rivers. They can also sometimes be seen outside this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most of them are afraid of humans and would run away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live in the ocean, their main habitat is in estuary rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travellers the peace of mind that they will have somewhere to sleep once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have special agreements with specific hotels, but you can also book accommodation through other types of travel agents, such as camping sites.
Travel agencies usually offer packages including breakfast, transport from/to airport, or even packages combining flight and accommodation.
They can also reserve a place for you if you need time to think about the offer or to procure other documents necessary for your destination (for example, a visa).
Any change or request must be made to the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants decide to camp on site, and most consider that this is an integral part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the musical event, you will have to arrive early to find a well-placed camping site.
Don't forget that even if the music concerts are over on the main stages, other music concerts can continue until late at night on other festival sites.
Some festivals have special family camping areas.
If you cross the north of the Baltic in winter, be sure to check the location of the hut, as the ice crossing can cause unbearable noise at the most exposed huts.
Cruises to St Petersburg include time spent in the city. Passengers on cruises are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos generally make a lot of efforts to maximise the time and money spent by their customers. There are rarely windows and clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They generally offer special offers of food, drinks and entertainment to maintain the good mood of guests and keep them there.
On some sites, it is the premises that offer free alcoholic beverages. However, drunkenness impairs judgement, and all good players should know that it is crucial to remain sober.
Anyone who drives to high latitudes or crosses mountain passes must consider the possibility of snow, ice or cold temperatures.
On the icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you cannot drive like you were on tarmac.
While snowstorms are raging, it can fall very quickly enough snow to block you.
The visibility may also be limited by snow or ice or by condensation or frost on the windows of vehicles.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal in many countries, and the traffic is practically uninterrupted all year round.
Safaris are perhaps the most popular tourist attraction in Africa and the most memorable moment for many visitors.
In everyday parlance, the term'safari' refers to an African excursion, and in particular to a wildlife safari, which is intended to witness the spectacular spectacle of wild animals in their natural habitat.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach close to cars and the standard equipment allows for good observation.
 Lions, leopards and lionesses are sometimes timid and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as 'walking in the bush', 'walking safari' or 'footing') consists of walking, either for a few hours, or for several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympic Games, after hosting the Games in 1964.
If you have booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you will be facing a difficult situation.
The cancellation policies vary, but from mid-March, most cancellation policies based on the coronavirus do not extend to July 2020, the date on which the Olympic Games had been planned.
We expect that most events' tickets will cost between 2 500 and 130 000 yens, typical tickets costing about 7 000 yens.
Wet clothes can be ironed more easily. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards which can be borrowed, even if there is no iron in the room. 
If you don't have a iron or you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if you find one.
Don't let the fabric overheat (which can cause shrinkage or burn it).
There are various methods of water purification, including some which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it is enough to boil water for a minute; in others, it is necessary to boil it for several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you have a problem, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter pests they do not know in their home region.
Parasites can contaminate food, cause irritations or, in the most serious cases, cause allergic reactions, spread venom or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals which can injure or kill people by force, are not generally considered parasites.
In some areas, duty-free shops present an opportunity to buy goods exempted from VAT and duties.
Travellers to countries where duties are high can sometimes save substantial amounts, in particular on alcoholic drinks or tobacco.
The Buffalo-Pittsburgh section of the Buffalo-Toronto highway is the most difficult section of the highway on account of its frequent passing through isolated back country.
If you don't like to drive on country roads, keep your eyes open: the steep hills, narrow roads and tight curves prevail.
Speed limits displayed are considerably lower than in previous rounds and following ones – usually at 35 to 40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and stricter compliance is still more important than before.
On the other hand, mobile phone service is surprisingly much stronger here than on many other parts of the road, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cakes are rather good, and in Bavaria, they are very rich and varied, similar to those of their neighbour to the south, Austria.
Fruit cakes are a common feature of the season: apples are baked and baked into cakes all year round, while pears and plums are in season in summer.
Many German bakery products also contain nuts, almonds and other nuts. Popular cakes often go well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want small but tasty Berliners, try the Berliners, also known as Pfannkuchen or Krapfen according to regions.
A curry is a dish made up of herbs and spices, accompanied by meat or vegetables.
A curry dish can be'solid' or 'liquid', depending on the amount of sauce it contains.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in the south of India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesia having 17 000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines present in all of the country.
However, when this term is used without any other qualification, it tends to refer to foods from the central and eastern parts of the island of Java.
Now, widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a range of simple dishes, the predominant flavours being the nuts, the peppers, the sugar (especially the coconut sugar of Java) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are foot rests for the rider, which hang from each side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability to the user, but they can pose a security problem: in fact, the user's feet can get stuck in the shoe.
If a rider is thrown from a horse, but has a leg caught in the stirrup, he could be dragged if the horse escapes. To minimise this risk, a number of measures of safety can be taken.
Firstly, most horses wear riding boots with a flat sole and a narrow heel.
Then there are some saddles, in particular English saddles, have safety bars which allow a rider to fall off the saddle if the rider is pulled back by a rider who falls.

Skiing and snowboarding are popular winter sports that involve sliding down a snowy slope with skis or snowboards attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity that has many enthusiasts, sometimes called'ski bums', who organise their entire holidays around skiing in specific places.
The idea of skiing is very ancient: some prehistoric paintings show skiers dating for some of 5 000 years ago!
Skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 16th century; the first ski club in a recreational sense was founded in 1861 in Australia by Norwegians.
Skiing: this activity is also called Nordic skiing, cross-country skiing or skiing in the mountains.
It resembles alpine skiing, but does not include the general alpine activities, which are practiced on rocky terrain and require the use of much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of skiing as a similar hiking route.
In good conditions, you can walk a little further than you can on foot – but you will rarely reach the speeds of skiing without a heavy pack on a muddy slope.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but containing several independent countries. In normal circumstances, travelling through several countries involves several visa applications and several passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, works a little like one country in this regard.
As long as you are in this zone, you can usually cross borders without having to go through passport controls.
In addition, having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply separately for each Member State of the Schengen area, which allows you to save time, money and administrative formalities.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique. Some tax authorities define objects over 100 years old as antiquities.
The criteria vary according to the place one is in; in some parts of the world, as in North America, the age limit can be lower than that in force in Europe.
Artisanal products may be considered as antiquities even if they are less ancient than similar industrial products.
Ranging of reindeer herding is a means of subsistence for Samis and the culture surrounding this trade is of great importance to many other professions.
Although, according to tradition, all Samis did not live in large-scale reindeer farming, they lived off fishing, hunting and other similar activities, and used reindeer mainly as livestock.
Today, many Samis practice modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Lapland, the Sami region.

The violent weather is the generic term for all dangerous weather phenomena which may cause damage, social disruption or loss of human life.
Unfavourable climatic conditions may occur anywhere in the world, and they may be of several kinds, depending on geographical, topographical and meteorological characteristics.
Violent winds, heavy rain, excessive precipitation and forest fires are the manifestations of violent weather, just as tornadoes, hurricanes, and marine storms are.

A training normally lasts for 2 to 5 days and includes role playing, lots of first aid, and sometimes a training in the use of weapons.
Wildlife books and magazines are common, but war-related publications are scarce.
Travellers who are planning to undergo a gender reassignment abroad should ensure that they have in their possession valid travel documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with the gender of the bearer not indicated (X) or to update documents to reflect the bearer' s name and gender wishes varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honour these documents is as variable as the willingness of foreign governments to honour the documents themselves.
Security checkpoint searches have also become much more intrusive in the era of post-11 September 2001.
Transgender people in the pre-op phase should not expect to be scanned in order to preserve their privacy and dignity.

Travellers who have had a hard time adjusting to the new culture have sometimes had a lot of trouble adjusting to their home culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and have lost some of your old habits.
At first, when you went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travellers in a new country must adapt.
People may not be anticipating that patience and understanding are also necessary for travellers and travellers returning home.

The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and the various pyramids are lit.
The Shetland Islands are claimed by several nations and have the largest number of research stations and 16 are active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. The island of King George, with the village of Villa Las Estrellas, is the largest.
Other examples: Livingston Island and the disappointment caldera, where the active volcano lagoon of an island still active offers a spectacular natural harbour.
Ellsworth Land is the southern part of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula are melted into the plateau, then reappear to form the Ellsworth Mountains, which run for 360 km and are crossed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern chain, or Sentinel, contains the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which stands at 4892 m.
In remote areas without cellular network, you may not have any other choice but to use satellite telephony.
A satellite phone does not replace a mobile phone, because you need to be outside and have a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
It is a service often used by navigation, including boats and yachts, as well as by expeditions that require data transmission and telephony.
Your local telecoms operator should be able to tell you more about this service.

Finland is a popular destination for recreational boating. The "Land of the thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, in lakes and in coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht in the archipelagoes and lakes. 
While the archipelago coasts and the largest lakes are actually quite large enough for a yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Sailing is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden and New Zealand are in the same situation, but apart from that, it is a unique case (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one to 40).
Most Baltic cruises are characterized by a prolonged stay in St Petersburg, in Russia.

Some people say that understanding something about the workings of aircraft and what happens during a flight can help to overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or on the fact that you do not have control.
The fast delivery companies are well paid to deliver fast. Often, in an urgent repair, the question of time is crucial for documents, goods or spare parts that relate to them.
And if you look at the evolution of the information technology giants, you will notice that they started their operations only a few years ago and were then very small. In other words, small and medium-sized businesses have the opportunity to take advantage of these modern technologies and use them to
If they had sent goods by air freight, on certain routes, it would have taken days to clear customs and to unload the goods.
The only way to do this was to send it as registered baggage. The airline regulations will not allow them to send a bag without a passenger, and that's where you intervene.
The easiest way to travel first class or business class is to pay a big sum of money for this privilege (or, better still, ask your company to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: generally you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare and eleven times for first class!
Generally speaking, it is pointless to try to get discounts for business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that they can count on certain types of passengers who are prepared to pay very high prices for the privileges of speed and comfort, and they set their prices accordingly.
The capital of the Republic of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is very widespread.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that is suffering from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, equipped with its own government and currency, but recognised by no member state of the United Nations.
The economic links between these two parts of the Moldavian Republic have been restored despite the failure of the political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.

Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Don't make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Don't make the site look like a graffiti site by painting or scratching graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, most of them understand it, and most people are able to speak Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, because the law establishes that it is the first official language.
