It confirms not only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already very widely accepted, but provides details that the fossils cannot usually provide, such as colour and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this bird's feathers were brown on top and pale or carotened on the bottom.

The feather structure suggests that they were not used in flight but rather for temperature regulation or display.

She then took part in the slalom, where she received a 'did not finish' (DNF) in her first race. 36 of 116 competitors received the same result in this race.
His other race, the slalom, enabled him to finish tenth in the sitting women’s group with a combined time of 4:41.30, that is to say 2:11 minutes less than the Austrian Claudia Loesch, who was first, and 1:09 minutes less than the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani, who was ninth.
In the category of women sitting skiers, four skiers have not reached the finish line; in the slalom race, 45 skiers out of 117 in this race have not been able to place themselves.
The police of Madhya Pradesh found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
The deputy inspector general D. K. Arya said: "We have arrested five people for violating the Swiss citizen, and we have recovered her mobile phone and laptops.
The accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
 Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the police commissioner, said that the accused had their faces covered when they appeared before the court.
While three people were present in the house when the car hit it, no one was injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured to the head.
The road where the accident took place was temporarily closed to allow rescue teams to extract the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to hospital at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
It was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son by the Sheriff Court of Edinburgh.
She is in custody awaiting trial and her trial, but eyewitness testimony could be compromised because her portrait has been widely disseminated.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but the Scottish courts have considered that publishing photos was potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, of Dundee University, notes that "journalists seem to be following a dangerous line if they publish photographs, etc. of suspects.
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is responsible for the entire prosecution, has said to reporters that no other comment will be made at least until the prosecution.
According to the leak, the document will deal with the dispute at the border that the Palestinians claim on the basis of the existing borders before the Middle East war of 1967.
In addition to the other matters discussed, there is the future State of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of ten years from the signing of an agreement, whereas the Palestinian Authority only consents to a period of five years.
The shooters of the additional parasite control trial were closely monitored by rangers, because the trial was closely controlled and its effectiveness assessed.
In the context of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) inc., qualified volunteers have been recruited, in the context of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, temporary conservation manager for the NPWS, the four hunters designated for the first killing season have been properly trained and instructed in safety procedures.
Martelly has appointed a new provisional Electoral Council (CEP) made up of nine members.
It is the fifth PEC of Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the dissolution of the previous CEP in the context of a package of measures intended to engage the country on the path to new elections.
This commission was the response of Martelly to the widespread protests against the regime that started in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the absence of elections, which were due to take place in 2011.
About 60 iPods malfunctioned, resulting in six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been informed of 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy and Finance informed Apple that it had received 34 additional incidents of overheating, which it described as ‘not serious’.
The Ministry of Finance responded by saying 'it is really regrettable' that the report was postponed by Apple.
The earthquake struck the Mariannes at 7:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday)
The Emergency Management Office for the Marianne Islands of Northern Ireland has stated that no damage has been reported in this country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre has said there is no sign of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer abducted tourists from Hong Kong in diverting their bus to Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and six of them have been confirmed to have died so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, have been released prematurely, as well as the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took over the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the loo. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and has now become a doctor.
He went on to medical training and started working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When he was working at the hospital, Liggins started to investigate premature births during his spare time. 
His research has shown that if a hormone is administered, it would accelerate the lung maturation of the baby.
Xinhua reported that the government investigators recovered two flight recorders (or "black boxes") on Wednesday.
Other fighters also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Queen of the extreme. My first manager. Luna died the night of two moons. A unique moment, just like she. A strong woman.
Dustin ‘ Goldust’ Runnels commented that ‘ Luna was as strange as me... or even more... I love her and she will be missed... I hope she rests in a better place.’
A survey conducted among 1 400 people before the federal elections in 2010 revealed that the number of opponents to the transformation of Australia into a republic had increased by 8 % since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the federal election campaign that she thought Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 per cent of those questioned share this view, and wish that Queen Elizabeth II is the last monarch to rule Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 % of those questioned think Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 % think Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was required to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical condition was questioned.
He could not take the necessary medications to overcome his pain, these being banned within the Games.
 Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest known prime number to date.
Many people have checked the discovery using different equipment and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
The comets may have been a source of water for the earth, as well as organic matter that can form proteins and promote life.
The scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, and in particular how the Earth was formed, because comets have collided with it for a long time.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor in January and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He described the rumours as ‘babble and nonsense’.
We think he will be running for the presidency in 2016.
According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that would allow aircraft to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, reducing carbon emissions.
It is based on satellite technology, and not on the ground-based radar systems used previously, which allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more detailed information.
The additional transport is non-existent and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking and relay stations are not available on the ground.
The fear of not having enough transport has led to the possibility that the match could be played in an empty stadium, without the fans of the teams.
A study published on Thursday in the Science journal has revealed the genesis of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and from Uppsala University in Sweden have indicated that the new species had evolved in only two generations, although this process has been estimated much longer, due to the reproductive interbreeding between a Darwin's finch endemic, Geospiza fortis, and the finch immigrant, Geospiza conirostris.
You can shape gold in many ways. It can be rolled into tiny pieces.
It can be twisted and woven into fine threads, and it can be hammered or laminated into sheets.
It can be made very fine, and glued onto another metal. It can be so fine that it has sometimes been used to decorate hand-painted images in manuscripts called "enlumined manuscripts.
That's what we call a chemical product's pH. You can make an indicator by using carrot juice.
The juice of cabbage changes colour according to the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the chemical tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electron (because hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron)." #
Mix the dry powders together, then, with clean hands and moist ones, press them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will produce an odd sensation and produce a shell-like effect.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets equipped with a flush in almost all houses, connected to a sophisticated sewage
Found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece, were remains of sewer systems.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, in Persia and China. In Roman times, public baths sometimes included toilets where men and women could meet.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite receives the call in space and then returns it to Earth almost instantaneously.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts a part of our light and our vision.
A giant rocket of more than 30 metres high is required to put a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in many ways. The greatest advantage it has given us is that it has made transport much simpler and faster.
It has brought us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
In the lower section are medium-sized carnivores that eat medium-sized prey, including rabbits, deer and other cattle.
In addition, there are many small cats (including free-roaming cats) that eat small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a special task assigned to each feline, preventing it from competing with the others.
The lions are the most sociable cats, living in large groups called herds.
The packs are made up of one to three adult males, as well as a number of females and cubs.
Women are usually very close to each other, their families being composed of a large number of sisters and daughters.
The lions' troops act like packs of wolves or dogs, animals which are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in their behaviour, and also very deadly for their prey.
Balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (but sometimes difficultly), swim, jump great distances and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is part of the same family (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four big cats are the only ones capable of roaring.
The roar of the tiger does not sound like the roar of the lion, but rather a phrase that would be a cry and a roar.
The ocelot is a voracious carnivore. It catches monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if it can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than him.
According to scientists, ocelots hunt and find prey (prey) by smelling their tracks on the ground.
They see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision, and they move also very furtively. The ocelots hunt their prey by blending into their environment before leaping on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it is derived (for example, if it moves over a mountain range or river, or if it moves to a new island so that it cannot easily return to its former location), it often finds itself in a different environment than it was previously.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so that the new population will need new characteristics or adaptations to be a powerful competitor compared to what it had previously.
The original population has not changed at all, it still needs the same adaptations.
As time goes by, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look more and more like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they will no longer be considered to be of the same species.
We call this process ‘speciation’, which means simply the formation of new species. The speciation is an inevitable and very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, exhale).
Plants produce their food by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses and clothes out of plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The great white shark was the superpredator of the time, he didn't fear anything, except other great white sharks.
His long jaws were equipped with more than 70 sharp teeth, as well as a series of additional teeth in the palate, so that anything that crossed his path could not escape.
We don't know for sure, but it is possible that he had a tongue-twister. His diet included turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and it is possible that he was cannibal.
He attacked everything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur such as a T. rex was not big enough against him.
While the Romans ate what we know today, they ate strange or unusual dishes, including deer, pigeons, snails and cockroaches, as well as the hare, a sort of rodent.
Another difference: while the poor and the woman ate their food sitting on chairs, the rich men loved to organise banquets where they rested on the side while they ate their meal.
Roman meals of antiquity could not include these foods from America or Asia which were introduced in Europe centuries later.
For example, they did not have maize, tomatoes, or potatoes, nor did any ancient Roman ever taste of lamb.
The Babylonians built temples for each of their gods, which were regarded as the dwellings of the god.
People sacrificed to the gods and priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had a courtyard, then a sanctuary inside which only priests could access.
Some of the pyramidal temples, the ziggurats, were sometimes built as part of a temple.
The summit of the tower was a special shrine for the god.
In the hot Middle East climate, the house was not so important.
The bulk of the Jewish family’s life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were only open displays, giving onto the street. Houses were built of stone. 
As there were no large forests in Canaan, the wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In Scandinavian sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder that he found Greenland - and named it - in his travels further west.
But regardless of its discovery, the Eskimo people lived there in the past.
While each country is 'Scandinavian' there are many differences between the people, the kings, the customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the film Benjamin Gates and the Templar Treasure, you may think that a treasure map has been drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although there is a stamp on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, you could read the words 'Original Declaration of Independence dated 4 July 1776'. The text is on the bottom of the document, reversed.
While nobody is entirely sure who wrote it, we know that at an early stage of its existence, the great scroll (which measures approximately 29 inches three-quarters on 24 inches) was rolled up. 
It is therefore likely that the rating was added simply as a label.
The landing day and the subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
She was governed by French Vichy-era collaborators, who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupying power instead of facing it.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies landed in the south of France, an invasion called Operation "Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French Forces had liberated the south of France and were heading for Germany.
A civilisation is a unique culture shared by a significant number of people who live and work in cooperation, a society.
The word 'civilization' is derived from the Latin word 'civis', which means civil and which is related to the Latin words 'civis', which means citizen, and 'civitas', which means city or state and which also indicates, in some way, the size of the society to which it relates. 
The city-states are the pioneers of nations. A civilisational culture involves the transmission of knowledge on several generations, a durable cultural legacy and an equitable distribution.
Minority cultures are often disappearing without leaving any historically relevant traces and are not recognized as genuine civilizations.
In the revolutionary war, the thirteen States first formed a weak central government — the Congress being its only component — under Articles of the Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes and, as there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on the authorities of the state, often less cooperative, to enforce its acts.
He did not have the power to derogate from tax laws or from customs duties between Member States.
The articles required unanimous consent of all the Member States before they could be amended and the Member States took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, with Germany's national team, the second most successful team in the world and they won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
In popular sports, football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, equestrian sports, rugby, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 are included.
Skiing is the most popular sport in the North, Italians participating in international competitions and Olympic games.
Japan has 7 000 islands (the biggest being Honshu), which makes it the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the islands that make up it, Japan is often referred to, geographically, as an 'archipelago'.
The first information about Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, while European sailors passing through it gave it the name of Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the south west of Taiwan, introducing a transformation of traditional agricultural practices and employing Chinese workers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) take control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declare it as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after his defeat in the Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Treaty, by which it ceded Taiwan to Japan, which was then in control of the island until 1945.
The Inca citadel is made up of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the sun temple and the three-window room.
Most of the buildings surrounding the complex were rebuilt to provide better views of their original appearance.
In 1976, thirty per cent of the Machu Picchu had been restored and this restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format of photographic film is 35 mm; it was the most common format of film used in the late analogue era.
It is still made today, but what is important is that its image format is inherited from the digital camera sensor format.
The 35 mm format is actually 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
So we say that the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest of integer ratios) is 3:2.
A large number of common formats (APS family, for example) are equal to this aspect ratio or are close to it.
The third party rule, which has been badly treated and often ridiculed, is a simple directive which stimulates dynamism while offering a high level of protection.
It indicates that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the vertical and horizontal lines dividing the image (see example).
In this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, was being questioned.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has bound the European states together despite the differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power touched everyone, from the King to the street urchin.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to relieve suffering and poverty and that the church's money is there specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church was in Rome for more than 1000 years and this concentration of power and money has led many people to ask whether this doctrine was respected.
After the outbreak of hostilities, the United Kingdom established a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade has been widely regarded as violating internationally accepted and codified norms.
The UK mines international waters to prevent ships from venturing into entire areas of the sea, which is thus a threat even to neutral ships.
As this tactic did not elicit a timid reaction, Germany expected a similar reaction to its underwater war without limits.
For many years, most citizens and nations showed a preference for pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, the nations wished to avoid that such a situation could ever happen again.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four hundred in his name, a poetry book and a recommendation letter from Charles Batchelor (his previous employer) to Thomas Edison.
China had a unique way of showing the different periods of its history; each step of China or each family in power was a distinct dynasty.
Among each dynasty, there have also been periods of unstable provinces. The most well-known of these periods is the Three Kingdoms period that lasted for 60 years between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty.
In these periods, fierce battles have taken place between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms were one of the most bloody periods in Chinese history. Thousands of people died in battle to sit on the throne of the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political repercussions such as the use of the metric system, the passing of absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people and not to one single leader.
As well, after the Revolution, the jobs were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and the most talented to succeed.
It is the same for the army, because the ranking of armies is no longer based on the class, but on the calibre.
The French Revolution also inspired many other working class people in other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions that transcended the worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that became famous under the name of 'Hira' on the mountain of 'Noor' (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which survived at the time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad’s spiritual inclinations.
Located at the top of one of the mountains in the north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
 " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " 
Up there, you can only look at the clear sky and the many mountains surrounding it. From inside the cave, you can only see or hear very little of this universe.
The Great Pyramid of Gizeh is the only of the Seven Wonders that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians during the third millennium BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many gigantic structures erected in honour of the Pharaohs who died.
The Giza Plateau, or 'Giza Necropolis', in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, contains several pyramids (the largest being the most imposing), several small tombs, many temples and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built to honour the pharaoh Khéops, and many smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honour his wives and his family.
The symbol ‘push’ looks like a V and the symbol ‘pull’ looks like a staple or a square with a missing bottom.
The top means you have to start with the tip and push the bow, and the bottom means you have to start with the arrow (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the arrow.
A bow upwards produces a softer sound, while a bow downwards produces a louder and more assertive sound.
Don't forget to write your own names on the pencil, but don't forget that the printed archets are for a musical motif, and that you should therefore generally respect them.
On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, eleven years old, and Louis-Charles, four years old), and the sister of the king, Madame Elisabeth, all terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a
In a carriage, they went back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and screamed threats against the king and the queen.
The king and queen were forced to open the windows of their carriages because of the crowd.
At a point, a crowd member brandished the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles before the terrified queen.
The American imperialist war expenditures in the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial American regime to cover a large part of the expenses and interest of the bonds issued by the banks of Wall Street.
Of course, the superprofits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people could constitute the basic interests of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context in which the order was created.
These events took place during the period generally considered to be the High Middle Ages – a period of European history from the eleventh to the thirteenth century (1000-1300).
The Middle Ages Central preceded the High Middle Ages and followed by the Low Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from the technological push or the imperative to a strict sense of which the destiny of humanity is dictated by a logical underpinning linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies.
Many interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: technological development itself takes place beyond cultural and political influences, and technological change has an impact on societies that are intrinsically conditioned rather than socially.
For instance, one could say that the automobile is necessary to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a few cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Massive ownership of cars also leads to an increased incidence of road traffic accidents, which leads to the development of new techniques in the field of health care for treating the body injuries.
Romanticism presented an important cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
According to Romantic theories, geography would have shaped individuals and, over time, customs and a culture associated with this geography would have emerged. These, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris is known as the capital of the fashion world of the contemporary world, Constantinople was regarded as the capital of the medieval Europe.
His reputation as the centre of luxury began around 400 BC and lasted until 1100 AD.
His status has declined over the twelfth century, mainly because the Crusaders returned with presents such as silk and spices, which the Byzantine markets could not compete with.
It was at this time that the title of the capital of fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic architecture reached its peak between the 9th and 11th centuries and then declined in the 13th century.
At first, the dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture, to the east.
However, due to the slowness of communication means, Western modes could lag behind by 25-30 years.
In the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of the time, following the Crusades, was the use of buttons for closing clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is a form of agriculture practiced to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, often organic, using traditional seeds from the region, combined with crop rotation or other simple techniques to maximise yield.
Historically, most farmers practised subsistence farming and that is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures are groups of people who feel neglected by the social norms and share the same ideas which enable them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnic origin, class, location and / or sex of members.
The criteria that determine a subculture as distinct from the mainstream can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
Subculture members often signal their membership by distinctive and symbolic use of style, which encompasses fashions, maniérismes and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to take inspiration from the few unfortunate cases of children who, by neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse, have not been socialized by adults during their childhood.
Children considered to be 'wild' or'savage'. Some children were locked up by their own parents; in some cases, the abandonment of this child was due to the parents' rejection of a severe intellectual or physical disability that the child suffered.
Children who have been abandoned or run away from home may have suffered serious abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing.
Others would have lived alone in the wild; some would have lived alone in the wild.
When raised entirely by non-human species, wild children display almost identical behaviours to those exhibited by their species-raisers, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
As learning projects should make learning easier and more interesting, the support goes further.
Support is not a method of learning but rather a means of helping learners who discover a new teaching such as the use of a new programme or the beginning of a new project.
Supports can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but the little guy at Microsoft Office is also one.
Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are intended to guide, explain and guide students through procedures that would have been too difficult to manage by the student alone.
Children are placed in foster homes for very diverse reasons, from neglect to maltreatment, from extortion to bribery.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment which is not stimulating, attentive and educational, but that is the case.
We perceive the family placement system as a safe zone for these children.
Our family placement scheme is supposed to provide safe, loving homes, caring nurses, stable education and reliable healthcare.
The placement in family homes is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were previously removed.
Internet combines mass communication elements and interpersonal communication elements.
The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approach to usages and gratifications.
For example, 'learning' and'socialization' are seen as major factors promoting Internet use (James et al., 1995).
‘Personal involvement’ and ‘continuous relationships’ have also been identified as being new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied the public reactions to the internet sites.
Video recording has led to great discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, that is, facial expressions during a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect if a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, has indicated how people with brain damage are still able to assess the sincerity of the speech accurately.
He even suggests that such human-animal interpretation abilities may be found in domestic dogs.
The research of the twentieth century has shown that there are two genetic reservoirs: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and the selection removes it from the gene pool of expressed variations.
The segregation and recombination alternate between the two basins at each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a non-human primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet its nutritional needs from available plant resources.
In addition, a lack of response has serious consequences: growth disorders, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The most easily accessible resources would be the proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult to digest for us, unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal-based foodstuffs (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest and provide a large amount of proteins containing all essential amino acids.
In all fairness, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors have solved their 'protein problem' in a similar way that chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentional waking during your sleep and the unconscious relaxation after (from 10 to 60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock, so that you can wake up without waking up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock while you are asleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other possibilities based on the biorhythm include drinking a lot of liquids before going to bed (especially water or tea, reputed to be diuretics), which forces you to wake up to urinate.
The degree of peace within a person opposes to the degree of tension in his or her body and mind.
The less tension there is, the more the present life force is positive. Each person has the opportunity to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way is our own tension and our negative emotions.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been enriched by the mahayana path and by many Indian techniques of yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (illumination) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The Tibetan meditation centre is the yoga of the deity. It is through visualisation of different deities that the channels of energy are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of awakening is created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, deep conflicts between their different systems, methods and cultures ended the entente between these two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
She would last for 40 years and see real combat, through substitute armies, on battlefields in Africa and Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defence was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganise along the Romanian front.
But these plans were obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800 000 Red Army soldiers arrived and created the Bieloruss-Ukrainian front after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, as well as other international treaties, bilateral or multilateral, that they be bilateral or multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods through the oceans.
The work of the armed forces has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and your goods, while interfering with your enemy's ability to move his people and his goods.
One of the most recent examples of this situation has been the campaign North Atlantic during the Second World War. The Americans were trying to cross the Atlantic Ocean to help the British.
At the same time, the German Navy, using mainly U-Boats, tried to stop this trade.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as it has done for the rest of Europe.
It seems that the sheep were domesticated for the first time about 10 000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures began to keep them close to them so that they could easily access milk, fur, hair and skin.
Domestic cattle were usually kept in herds which wandered on hills or other pastures, often cared for by shepherds who were most often children or adolescents, similar to the more familiar term of shepherds.
The 'wagonways' were built in England in the 16th century.
While the railway tracks were simply made of parallel planks of wood, they allowed horses to pull them to greater speeds and to carry heavier loads than on the roads which were slightly more accident-prone during the day.
The crossbars were introduced early to keep the tracks in place. However, it was soon realised that the tracks would be more effective if they were provided with a steel bar on top.
It has become a common practice, but the iron has caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails were introduced.
The first means of locomotion was walking: humans began walking upright two million years ago with the arrival of the Homo Erectus ("right-handed man").
Their predecessors, the australopithecines, did not walk upright as usual.
There are bipedal specializations in fossils of Australopithecus afarensis from around 4,2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs already seven million years ago.
We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even campaign in the hope of mitigating the sufferings to come.
In many cases, it is a symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not want just a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems and disable them.
It is clear that the world has changed thanks to the advances in science and technology made by human beings, and that the problems have become more important because of the overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of the human race.
After it was adopted by the Congress on 4 July, a draft signed by the House President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to a few blocks away, to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
In the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, known as 'Dunlap Broadsides'.
The public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the Independence Hall on July 8.
One of them was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who read it to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy was received in London on 10 August.
The 25 sheets Dunlap that are known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript copy has not survived.
Many palaeontologists now believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive. They are called birds.
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly.
There are many things about birds that look like dinosaurs.
They have scales on their feet and claws, they lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information which are encoded in binary form.
A binary number can have only one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary numbers, or bits to use the computer jargon.
An internal poisoning may not be visible immediately. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are sufficiently general to allow a diagnosis to be made immediately.
The best indicator of an internal poisoning is probably the presence of a closed container of toxic household chemicals or medicines.
Look at the label to find out the specific first aid instructions for this poison.
The term 'insect' is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term derives from an ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are very adapted to parasitizing humans.
The slugs, like bed bugs, are nidicolous, that is, they are adapted to live in the nest or host's habitat.
In the United States, there are about 400 000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which makes it the leading neurological condition among young and middle-aged people.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, consisting of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have MS than men.
A couple can very well feel that it is not in their interest, nor in the child's interest, to look after the education of a baby.
These couples can choose to adopt their baby.
In the context of adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main purpose of science is to understand how the world works by scientific method. This method guides in fact most scientific research.
However, it is not the only, experimentation, and an experiment is a test which serves to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, to ask questions and make observations, but which also orients scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers have focused on ancient texts, and in particular on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's opinions on all scientific issues, including psychology, were accepted.
With the decline of Greek knowledge, Western civilization has been cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed physiological rhythms depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which do not simply represent responses to periodic stimuli, have been documented for most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to operate for a certain period even without external stimulation.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacteria.
They have carried out two experiments to label either the phage DNA with a radioactive phosphorus, or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the extent of the genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only germline mutations can be passed on to children, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism is aimed at people who want to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, in particular wildlife and flora.
Hunting, fishing, bird watching, visiting parks and studying the information on the ecosystem are examples of activities on the spot.
You can go and see, photograph and discover orang-utans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave the small towns in cars to get to their places of work and cross other people who are going to work in the country they have just left.
In this dynamic transport bus, everyone is in some way connected to a private car-based transport system and supports it.
The science now shows that this massively carbon-based economy has pushed the biosphere out of its stable state which has supported human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about water quality or bridge collapses.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they break down every day? Transportation engineers are simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flows are the study of the movements of drivers and private vehicles between two points, and the interactions they exert between each other.
It is difficult to study traffic flow because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with 100 per cent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act in a reasonable range; so, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable range and can be represented mathematically approximatively.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) the flow, (2) the density and (3) the speed.
These relationships help to plan, design and operate road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly made it easier for them to escape from their enemies and find more effectively food and companions.
A lot of insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body.
It gives them more places to hide from predators.
Today, only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and ephemerals.
There are some thousands of years ago, a man called Aristarchus said that the solar system moved around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but many thought he was wrong : that the solar system moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
This seems reasonable, because the Earth does not feel the Earth is moving, is it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times the volume of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the largest river in the world, reaching up to 10 km wide.
More than 20 % of the water that falls from rivers in the world into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River arm is over 6 387 km (3 980 miles). It collects the water from thousands of small rivers.
While the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Great Pyramid of Gizeh never surpassed its size and the technical excellence of its construction.
Ancien Egyptians of the New Empire were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, who had then well over a thousand years.
Vatican has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest country in the world, and the least populated.
The Vatican City is writing its legislation and its official communications in Italian.
Italian is also the language of everyday use by most of the staff working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
The citizens of the Vatican City are all Catholics.
From antiquity, people have been familiar with basic elements such as gold, silver and copper, because they are found in nature as raw materials and are quite simple to mine using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, has theorised that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. It was earth, water, air and fire.
It was rather the four states of matter (in the same order) : solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although he also held the view that these would transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered as metals. Of course, there are also metals such as gold and silver.
There are also alloys that contain a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of minuscule particles called atoms.
The atoms are so small that billions of them could enter into the period at the end of this sentence.
So, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it was released.
Despite this, the emergence of new modes of writing has marginalized the pen to a more private status and has been used less frequently.
People now write messages on screens, without ever having to get near a pencil.
It is hard to imagine what the keyboard will look like when the next new thing arrives.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it combines a nucleus of a myriad of protons and neutrons.
Like if you were to make a hill climb on a heavy cart.
Some atoms have a volatile nucleus, so they tend to break up with little or no pressure.
The moon's surface is made up of rocks and dust. Its outer layer is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the visible side and 100 km on the hidden side.
It is thinner at the sea level and thicker under the continents.
There may be more lava on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are focused on the search for what makes people feel good or attracted.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires which have been internalized as they matured into adulthood.
These theories look at what drives some people to want what they do and what drives their environment to do or not do certain things.
Popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviours can emerge when a manager becomes the boss of former colleagues. From one end of the spectrum being to try to stay 'the good friend' (or 'the good friend').
This type of manager is not able to take controversial decisions, carry out disciplinary actions, carry out risk assessments, delegate responsibilities, and hold others responsible.
At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes a non-identifiable individual who feels that he/she must change everything that the group has created up to now and do things his/her way.
After all, the boss is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
That behaviour often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical team.
They have often more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet at different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
A truly invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also an unique element of a virtual team.
The "invisible" team is the management team to which each member reports. It sets the standards for each of them.
Why would an organisation want to create a structure of learning? One of the objectives related to the implementation of learning concepts is innovation.
When all the available resources are effectively used in the functional services of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can be expressed fully.
Thus, a process of working together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovative process to meet the customer's need.
Before an organisation is innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and its own learning culture.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used by organisations to achieve better results.
Neuroscientific data provide material evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research. They therefore allow us to reduce the field of research and make it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research.
We know for a long time that different types of damage, lesions, tumours and brain damage affect behaviour and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and materials to build models of simulation which help us understand the processes in our mind.
Although Artificial Intelligence is often heavily connoted with science-fiction, it is an extremely important part of computer science that studies the behaviour, learning and adapting intelligently of a machine.
Artificial intelligence research is aimed at automating tasks requiring an intelligent approach.
In the examples are included control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnostics and customer questions, as well as recognition of writing, voice and face.
These practices led to distinct disciplines, focused on the provision of solutions to the everyday problems faced by people.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and military, as it was put into practice in several home computer software and video games.
Excursions are integral to any school. Often, a teacher would like to take his students to places where a bus journey is not possible.
The solution is provided by technology in the form of educational virtual tours. Students can view the ancient objects of a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a beautiful work of art while sitting with their class.
Participating practically to a trip is also a good way to think about a trip and to share your experiences with future generations.
For example, students from Bennett High School in North Carolina design each year a website dedicated to their visit to the capital of the state. Each year, the website is updated, but the old versions are kept online for use as an album.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Even if students often try blogging with poor grammar and spelling, having a public audience makes the situation more likely to improve.
As students are often the most critical of the blog's author, the blogger begins to work to improve his writing in order to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging forces students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are an effective tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning well beyond the traditional school day.
When used well, blogs can enable students to strengthen their analytical and critical thinking skills: by reacting actively to online content, they can confront their own opinion to that of others and to express their own viewpoints on specific topics.
Ottawa is the charming capital of Canada and has a large number of art galleries and museums that highlight the past and present of Canada.
You will find more south the falls of Niagara and north, the Muskoka region and its environs which have a virgin natural beauty.
All these measures, and many more, make Ontario what foreigners regard as the quintessence of Canada.
The large areas further north are sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited at the wild state.
For a comparison that surprises more than one: There are more African-Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The Eastern African islands are located in the Indian Ocean, close to the African coast.
Madagascar is by far the largest country, and even a continent by itself, in terms of wildlife.
Most of the small islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known for being luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought the practice of Islam to the land and this religion has spread widely to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route which links Europe to India.
North, the region is defined by the Sahel, and south and east by the Atlantic Ocean.
To women: It is recommended that any woman who travels say that she is married, irrespective of her civil status.
It is also recommended to wear an alliance (which should not seem too precious.")
Women must realise that some cultural differences can lead to behaviours that they regard as harassment. It is, of course, common that they are followed, caught by the arm, etc.
Be firm in your refusal of advances, and don't be afraid to hold your ground (cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean it's acceptable!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Ptolemies, the Romans and the Merovingians as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese, who after destroying it had rebuilt it and named it Casa Branca, finally abandoned it in 1755 after a major earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city under the name of Daru l-Badya, and it was renamed Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in all of Morocco for shopping.
Around the old medina, you can easily find places where to buy Moroccan traditional products, such as tajines, pottery, leather goods, nargilehs and all sorts of bibelots, but it is all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located in the extreme east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano which buried most of the city's streets, in particular the city centre.
Although Goma is reasonably secure, any visit to the outside of Goma must be subject to investigation to understand the state of the fighting in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of the Nyiragongo volcano as well as for gorilla tracking treks among the least expensive in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motor taxi) to get around in Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 CFA for a short trip.
Combined with its relative remoteness, "Tombouctou" has become a metaphor for distant and exotic countries.
Today, Tombouctou is a poor city, although its reputation as a tourist attraction makes it a destination, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the World Heritage List as a threatened site because of the desert sands threatening its existence.
This was one of the major steps in the series " Wonders of the African World " on PBS.
The city contrasts strongly with the rest of the country, because it has a style more Arab than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the border south is the Crocodile River." #
The total area of the park is 19 500 km2, divided into 14 ecozones, each housing a specific fauna.
It is one of the most famous South African National Parks and considered to be the jewel of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As for all South African national parks, there are daily entry and conservation fees.
It may be advantageous to obtain a Wild Card which gives access to some South African national parks, as well as all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the name given to the territory of Hong Kong and represents the main centre of interest for many tourists.
The row of buildings that forms the horizon of Hong Kong was compared to a glittering bar chart, which is revealed by reflection in the Victoria Harbour.
To admire the most beautiful views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to Kowloon's seafront located opposite.
The vast majority of the urban development of Hong Kong is concentrated on the northern side of the harbour.
This is the place that the British colonists have invested. Thus, it seems to me to be a good starting point, if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this region.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest mangrove forest belt, stretching for 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the backwaters of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forest area in India is called the Sundarbans National Park.
Forests, however, are not only composed of mangrove swamps: they also contain some of the last vestiges of the majestic jungles that covered the Ganges plain in the past.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3 850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water/wetlands.
Sundarbans is a nature reserve since 1966, you will find about 400 Bengal tigers and about 30 000 spotted deer.
Buses leave the district bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, but most, especially those that serve the east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6 a.m. and 7 a. m.
Inter-district buses are often full, so it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese ships, which are comfortable and robust.
Collective taxis are a fast and comfortable way to get to places near, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock Bridge is a suspension bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to link the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint George's-de-l'Oyapock in Guyana.
The two towers are 83 metres high, it is 378 metres long and has two 3,50 m wide lanes.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. The structure was completed in August 2011, but it was opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge ought to be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs posts should be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group living in what is now the eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also practising subsistence farming.
Other indigenous tribes that populated the Chaco, such as the Guaycurú or the Payaguá, survived mainly by fishing, hunting, or gathering.
In the 16th century, Paraguay was called ‘the giant province of the Indies’, the result of the encounter between the Spanish conquistadors and the indigenous peoples.
The Spanish inaugurated the period of colonisation, which lasted for three centuries.
From the foundation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain a large part of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best teams and among the best polo players in the world.
The biggest polo tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
In addition, smaller tournaments and matches are sometimes organised here at other times of the year.
For information on polo tournaments and where to buy tickets for the matches, see the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Isle of Man is the Manx Pound (FKP) which is equivalent to a pound sterling (GBP).
The money can be exchanged at the only bank in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
The pound sterling is a widely accepted currency in the islands, while at Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the nearby islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, even if it is possible that British and American dollars will be accepted. Talk to the owners in advance to agree on a payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange money from the Maldives outside of the islands, so change it before you leave the islands.
Montevideo being located in the south of the Equator, the winter in the northern hemisphere corresponds to the summer in the southern hemisphere.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical zone and summer temperatures exceeding 30°C are common.
Winter can be misleadingly cold: temperatures rarely fall below zero, but wind and humidity combine to give the impression that it is colder than what the thermometer says.
There are no 'rainy' and 'dry' seasons: the rainfall is pretty constant all year round.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, they are wild animals; please do not feed them or disturb them.
According to the authorities of the park, you must stay at least 100 metres from wolves and bears and at least 25 metres from all other wild animals!
As docile as they might appear, the bison, the elk, the moose, and almost all the great animals can attack.
Every year, hundreds of visitors are injured because they did not keep a sufficient distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them some space.
In addition, you should know that odours attract wild animals, so avoid transporting or cooking odours-producing foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of about 40 000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and is the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a tragic naval standoff in 1889, when seven German, American and British ships refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
The Supreme Head of State Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was assassinated during a peaceful rally held in the city during the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement.
The beaches are numerous, because Auckland is at the mercy of two ports. The most popular ones are in three zones.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the district of North Harbour) lie on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay to Devonport to the south.
Most of the beaches are sandy and allow safe swimming, and most are shaded by Pohutukawa trees.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the chic suburb of Mission Bay and in Saint Heliers in the centre of Auckland.
The beaches, which are often frequented by families, have many shops along the coast. The bathing is safe there.
The main local beer is the 'Number One', a rather ordinary beer, but tasty and refreshing. There is also another local beer, the 'Manta'.
There are many French wines to taste, but the New Zealand and Australian wines will travel better.
You can drink tap water without any risk, but you can easily find bottled water if you have any concerns about it.
For Australians, the idea of a 'coffee cream' is foreign. A short black is an 'espresso', a cappuccino is filled with cream (not mousse) and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is Belgian standard. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips on the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries caused by one of these causes on the reef are rare.
However, follow the advice of authorities, obey all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
From October to April, north of 1770, the box jellyfish arrive near beaches and estuaries of rivers. They can also sometimes be seen outside of this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most of them are afraid of humans and would run away.
Salmon crocodiles do not live in the ocean, their main habitat is estuarine rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travellers the peace of mind that they will have somewhere to sleep once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but you can also book accommodation through travel agencies of other types, such as camping sites.
Travel agencies usually offer packages including breakfast, airport transfers or even packages combining flights and accommodation.
They can also hold your booking if you need time to think about the offer or to procure other documents necessary for your destination (for example, a visa).
Any change or request should however be addressed to the travel agency first and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants decide to stay at the festival site, and most of them think that this is part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the musical event, you will have to arrive early to find a well-placed camping area.
Don't forget that even if the main music performances are over, other music performances can continue until late at night on other sites of the festival.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the Baltic Sea in winter, be sure to check the location of the hut, because the crossing of the ice can cause unbearable noises at the most exposed huts.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include time spent in the city. Passengers on cruises are exempt from the visa requirement (see the conditions).
Casinos generally make a great deal of effort to maximise the time and money spent by their customers. There are rarely windows and clocks, and exits can be difficult to spot.
They generally offer special offers of food, drinks and entertainment to keep the guests happy and to keep them there.
On some sites, it is the premises that offer free alcoholic beverages. However, drunkenness impairs judgement, and all good players should know that it is crucial to remain sober.
Anyone who travels to high latitudes or crosses mountains must consider the possibility of snow, ice or cold temperatures.
On icy roads and icy conditions, friction is low and you cannot drive as if you were on tarmac.
In the blizzards, it can fall quite a lot of snow in a very short space of time to block you.
The visibility can also be limited by snow or ice or by condensation or frost on the windows of vehicles.
On the other hand, the presence of ice and snow is normal in many countries, and the traffic is practically uninterrupted all year round.
Safaris are perhaps the most popular tourist attraction in Africa and the most memorable moment for many visitors.
Safari" is a common term in everyday language for an African excursion, and especially for a safari in the African savanna, where the spectacle of wild animals in their natural environment is spectacular.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach close to cars and standard equipment allows them to be observed well.
Lion, leopard and lions are sometimes shy and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as 'footing','safari pédestre' or 'walking safari') consists of walking, either for a few hours, or for several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will take place in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, after hosting the Games in 1964.
If you have booked your flights and accommodation in 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you are likely to be in a difficult situation.
The policies of cancellation vary, but from March onwards, most cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, the date on which the Olympic Games had been planned.
We expect that most events tickets will cost between EUR 2 500 and EUR 130 000, while typical tickets will cost approximately EUR 7 000.
Drying clothes in the sun can make them easier to iron. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards which can be borrowed, even if there is no iron in the room. 
If you don't have a iron or if you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if you find one.
Avoid leaving the fabric too hot (which can cause shrinkage or in extreme cases, burn it).
There are different methods of water purification, including some that are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it is enough to boil water for a minute; in others, it is necessary to boil it for several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you have a problem, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter pest animals they do not know in their home region.
Parasites may contaminate food, cause irritations or, in the most serious cases, cause allergic reactions, spread venom or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals which can wound or kill people by force, are not usually considered parasites.
In some localities, duty-free shops present an opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and customs duties.
Travellers to countries where taxes are high can sometimes make considerable savings, especially on alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The most difficult section of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway is the section between Point Marion and Fairmont, which passes through isolated backcountry areas.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, keep an open mind: steep slopes, narrow roads and tight curves predominate.
Speed limits displayed are lower than in previous stages and are still stricter than before. They are usually between 35 and 40 mph (56-64 km/h) and strict compliance is still more important than before.
On the other hand, the mobile service is surprisingly much stronger here than on many other parts of the road, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cakes are rather good, and in Bavaria, they are very rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbour, Austria.
Fruit cakes are common in France: apples are baked and baked in cakes all year round, while pears and plums are in season in summer.
Many German bakery products also contain hazelnuts, almonds and other nuts. Popular German cakes often go well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but tasty Berliners, try the Berliners, also called Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region.
A curry is a dish made up of herbs and spices, accompanied by meat or vegetables.
A curry dish can be "solid' or "liquid', depending on the amount of sauce it contains. 
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in the south of India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesia having 17 000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines present in all of the country.
However, when this term is used without any other qualifying term, it tends to refer to foods from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a wide range of simple dishes, the predominant flavours being nuts, peppers, sugar (especially coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are the supports for the feet of the rider, which hang from each side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability to the user, but they can pose a problem of safety: in fact, the user's feet can remain trapped.
If a rider is thrown from a horse, but has a leg caught in the stirrup, he could be dragged if the horse escapes. To minimise this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
First, most horses wear riding boots with a flat sole and a narrow heel.
In addition, some saddles, in particular English saddles, have safety bars which allow a rider to fall off the saddle if the rider is pulled back by a rider who falls.
Valley of Cochamó – The excellence destination for rock climbing in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with many different granite faces and cliffs.
From the top of the mountains, the panoramas are unbeatable. The alpinists the world over are discovering new routes practicable on the slopes, where the possibilities are limitless. 
Downhill skiing, in particular skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports which consist in sliding down a snowy slope with skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity that has many fans, sometimes called'ski bums', who organise their entire holidays around skiing in specific places.
The idea of skiing is very ancient: paintings of caves showing skiers date for some of 5 000 years ago!
Skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 16th century; the first ski club in Australia was founded in 1861 by Norwegians.
Skiing: this activity is also called Nordic skiing, cross-country skiing or hiking.
It looks like alpine skiing, as well as alpine climbing, but without actually incorporating these activities, which are practiced on rocky terrain and require the use of skis and boots much stiffer.
Think of skiing as a similar hiking route.
In good conditions, you can walk a little further than you can on foot – but you will never reach the speeds of skiing without a heavy pack on a frozen track.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it contains many independent countries. In normal circumstances, travelling through several countries involves several visa applications and several passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, works a little like one country in this regard.
As long as you remain within this area, you can usually cross borders without going through passport control points.
In addition, having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply separately for each of the Member States of the area, which allows you to save time, money and administrative procedures.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique. Some tax authorities define items over 100 years old as antiquities.
The criteria vary according to where one is located; in some parts of the world, such as in North America, the age limit can be lower than that in force in Europe.
Artisanal products can be regarded as antiques even if they are less old than similar industrial products.
Renting reindeer is a major means of subsistence for Samis and the culture surrounding this trade is of great importance to many other professions.
Although, according to tradition, all Samis have not been involved in large scale reindeer herding, they lived from fishing, hunting and other similar activities, and used reindeer mainly as livestock.
Today, many Samis practice modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Lapland, the Sami region.
While widely used, especially among non-Romas, the term 'Gypsy' is often considered to be pejorative because of its association with negative stereotypes and an unfair image of the Roma people.
If the country in which you go is subject to a travel warning issued by your government, your overseas health insurance or travel insurance may be affected.
You can also consult other governments, but their advice is tailored to their citizens.
As an example, the citizens of the United States in the Middle East might be confronted with different situations from those of Europeans or Arabs.
The opinions are only a brief summary of the political situation of a country.
The opinions presented are often superficial, general and too simplified in comparison to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Violent weather is the generic term for any meteorological phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of life.
Very unfavourable weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and they can be of several kinds, depending on geographical, topographical and meteorological features.
Violent winds, hail, excessive precipitation and fires are forms and effects of violent weather, just as tornadoes, hurricanes, cyclones and tropical storms are.
Extreme weather phenomena, such as cold, snowy and windy storms, sandstorms and duststorms, are also included.
It is strongly recommended that travellers check the weather forecast for their destination region, knowing that this may have an impact on the routes they intend to take.
Anyone contemplating travelling to a country which could be regarded as a war zone should receive professional training.
A search on the Internet for "Cours in hostile environment" will probably provide the address of a local company.
A course will cover the issues raised here in much more detail, usually with a practical experience.
A training usually lasts for 2 to 5 days and includes role playing, lots of first aid, and sometimes a training in the use of weapons.
Wildlife books and magazines are common, but war-related publications are scarce.
Travellers who are planning to undergo a gender reassignment abroad must be able to provide valid documents for their return journey.
The governments' desire to issue passports with the sex not indicated (X) or to update documents to correspond to the desired name and sex varies.
The will of foreign governments to honour these documents is variable.
The security checkpoint searches have also become much more intrusive in the era of post-11 September 2001.
Transsexual people in the pre-op phase should not be expected to pass the scanners in order to preserve their privacy and dignity.
Storm-driven currents are the currents that return from breaking waves, often on a reef or equivalent.
Because of the underwater topography, the return flow is concentrated on a few deeper sections, and a fast current can form in the deep waters.
In most cases, deaths are due to exhaustion which results from attempting to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
When you leave the current, swimming back is not more difficult than it is usually.
You may try to aim at a place where you will not be caught again. It is also possible that, depending on your skills and whether you have been spotted or not, you may want to wait for help.
The shock of reintegration occurs earlier than the cultural shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer and is more serious.
Travelers who have had difficulty adjusting to the new culture have sometimes a great deal of difficulty adjusting to their home culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and have lost some of your own culture's habits.
At first, when you went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travellers in a new country have to adapt.
People may not be anticipating that patience and understanding are also necessary for travellers and travellers returning home.
The light and sound show at the Pyramid is one of the most interesting attractions in the region for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
Often, we hear the sound of tourists and hawkers. The history of sound and light is like a history book.
The Sphinx is the backdrop and the narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and the different pyramids are lit.
The Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the largest number of research stations and 16 of them are active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the mainland. The King George Island, with the village of Villa Las Estrellas, is the largest.
Other examples: Livingston Island and the Deception, where the still active caldera of a volcano offers a spectacular natural harbour.
Ellsworth Land is the Southern border of the peninsula, defined by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula are melting into the plateau, then reappearing to form the Ellsworth Mountains, a 360 km long chain of mountains that runs through the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, contains the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which stands at 4892 m.
In remote areas without cellular network, you may have no other choice but to resort to satellite telephony.
A satellite telephone does not replace a mobile telephone, because you need to be outside and have a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
This is a service often used by navigation, including boats, as well as by expeditions that require data transmission at a distance and telephony.
Your local telephone operator should be able to tell you more about the connection to this service.
Those who plan a year off have the opportunity to learn while travelling, and more and more of them are choosing this option.
This formula is particularly popular with young people who leave school, because it allows them to take a year off before university, without compromising their studies.
Often, having taken a year off to study abroad can actually give you better chances of going on to study at university in your own country.
Generally, you have to pay tuition fees for these educational programmes.
Finland is a popular destination for sailing. The "Land of the thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, in lakes and in archipelagos coastal.
You do not necessarily need a yacht in the archipelagoes and on the lakes.
While the coastal islands and the largest lakes are actually quite large for a yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Sailing is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden and New Zealand are in the same situation, but apart from that, it is a unique case (in the Netherlands, for example, the number is one to forty).
Most cruises on the Baltic are characterized by a prolonged stay in St. Petersburg, in Russia.
It means that you can visit the historic city for several days in total, while you sleep on the boat at night.
If you do not go to the ground with cruise excursions, you will not need a separate visa (from 2009).
The city of Berlin, in Germany, is mentioned in some brochures for cruises. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not at all located near the sea and no visit to this city is included in the cruise price. 
Traveling by plane can be a terrifying experience for all ages and from all walks of life, in particular if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It is not shameful: it is not different from the fears and fears that many people have about other things.
For some, understanding something about the operation of aircraft and what is going on during a flight can help to overcome a fear which is based on the unknown or on the fact that you do not have control.
Transport companies are well paid to deliver goods quickly. In many cases, in urgent repairs, the question of time is crucial for documents, goods or spare parts that relate to them.
On some roads, the big companies have their own planes, but on other roads and for the small ones, there was a problem.
If they had sent goods by air freight, on some routes, it would have taken days to clear customs and to unload the goods.
The only way to get it to the airport quicker was to send it as checked baggage. The airline regulations will not allow them to send an unaccompanied baggage, and that's where you come in.
The easiest way to travel first class or business class is to pay a big sum of money for this privilege (or, better still, ask your company to do it for you).
However, it is not cheap: generally you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare and eleven times for first class!
Generally, it is pointless to try to get discounts for business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that they can count on certain types of passengers who are willing to pay very high prices for the privileges of speed and comfort, and they set their prices in good faith.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is very common.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that is suffering from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict resulted in the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, with its own government and currency, but recognised by no member of the United Nations.
The economic links between these two parts of the Republic of Moldova have been restored despite the failure of the political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
With a population of 3.7 million, İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey, the second port after Istanbul, and a good platform for correspondence.
What was once the ancient city of Smyrna is today a modern commercial centre, developed and vibrant, located around an enormous bay, surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, the glass buildings and modern shopping centres are dotted with traditional red tiled roofs, the oldest market in the city, and old mosques and churches, although the city has a Mediterranean atmosphere which recalls more Europe than the traditional Turkish city.

Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Don't make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not deface the site by defacing or scratching graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and most people are able to speak Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, because the law establishes that it is the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan, but unforeseen disruptions are announced by an automated system in many languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
The Parisians have long been known to be egocentric, rude and arrogant.
Although this stereotype is often inaccurate, the best way to get along in Paris is to behave well, to act as someone of good manners. This will make your travels much easier.
The abrupt exteriors of the Parisian people disappear quickly if you show a modicum of courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely wooded, mainly of beech, oak and pine, and presents a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
The country has a great variety of plant communities due to the diversity of its microclimates, soils and altitudes.
The region also houses a very large variety of animal and bird species.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, wolf, owl, lynx, wild cat and the great tit can be seen there, as well as many common species.
When they visit a monastery, women must cover their knees and cover their shoulders as well.

Therefore, the reading of this introduction to Persian grammar would help you to learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand the phrases.
It is quite obvious that if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, those who speak a little Spanish might conclude prematurely that the Portuguese is sufficiently close to Spanish to be studied separately.
Premodern observatories are usually obsolete today, and remain in place as museums or educational sites.
As light pollution was not as serious back then as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, easier to access than those built in the modern era.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous infrastructures placed in remote regions where the weather conditions are favorable.
Hanami, the Japanese tradition of viewing the cherry blossoms, is part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where plum blossoms were the favourite flower.

Many traditions associated with these festivals have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians throughout the world.
It is customary to sleep out in the open at dawn to watch the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could well be that it is a spring and fertility ritual pre-Christian.
Traditional churches often hold a vigil on Easter Saturday during the Easter weekend, the congregations often breaking into the celebration at midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that have arrived on these islands have arrived originally by water, swimming or on floating objects, or by air.
Because of the great distance between the islands, the giant tortoise has been the main animal of pasture for the Galapagos islands.
Since the arrival of man to the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including cattle, horses, cows, pigs, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the arctic or antarctic regions in winter, you will be able to see the polar night, during which the sun does not rise above the horizon.
It is a good opportunity to admire the northern lights, because the sky will be dark almost all day.
