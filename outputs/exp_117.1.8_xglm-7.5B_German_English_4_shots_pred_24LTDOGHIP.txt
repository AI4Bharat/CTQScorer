This confirms not only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides details that fossils in general cannot provide, such as colour and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this bird were of a dark brown on the top and a lighter brown on the bottom.
The Fund also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well developed sheath called a quill, but other characteristics of feathers — hooks and barbules — the researchers concluded that the quill must have been an evolutionary development later than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or for heart function.
The researchers claimed that this is the tail of a young dinosaur, but the sample showed no feathers of an adult.

She is in custody until the prosecution and trial, but eyewitness statements could be false as her picture has been widely published.
This is a practice that is commonplace in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish judiciary operates differently, and the courts have regarded the publication of photographs as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee remarks: "Journalists seem to be crossing a dangerous line when they publish photographs or other material of suspects.
The Crown Office has indicated to journalists that at least until the prosecution no further comments will be made.
According to a leak, the document refers to the border dispute in which the Palestinians want to return to the status quo before the Six-Day War of 1967.
Other issues, which are supposedly covered, include the future of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel wants a military presence in the Jordan Valley for ten years from the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority is willing to accept such a presence for five years.
The hunters of the accompanying attempt to control the plague should be closely supervised by rangers, as the attempt has been monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited for the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Executive Director of Park Conservation and Heritage in NPWS, the four selected hunters received comprehensive security and training training.
Martelly has just appointed a new Provisional Election Commission (CEP) with nine members.
It is his fifth CEP within four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of the package of measures to steer the country in the direction of new elections.
The Commission was the response of the Haitian government to the widespread regime-critical protests which began in October.
The trigger for the sometimes violent protests was the failure to hold elections, some of which are due to be held in 2011.
Over 60 cases of overheating have been reported with iPods. In total, six fires have been set and four people have suffered minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that it had 27 accidents in connection with the equipment.
Last week, the METI announced that it had been informed by Apple of 34 more cases of overheating which it had classified as "not serious
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded by saying that it was really regrettable that the report had been moved by Apple.
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 p.m. on Friday (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The office for disaster management in the northern Marianes said that there were no damages reported in the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center had said that there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage, by kidnapping their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot with his M16 rifle at the tourists.
At least six hostages have been rescued and there are at least six confirmed deaths.
Six hostages, including the elderly and children, were released early.
The photographers took the place of an elderly lady when she had to go to the toilet.
Liggins followed in the footsteps of his father and became a medical doctor.
He became a midwife and took up his work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While he was working in the hospital, Liggins began to study premature contractions." #
His research showed that the application of a hormone accelerated the lung development of the fetus.
Xinhua reported that investigators from the government had recovered two "black box" flight recorders
Ringer colleagues paid tribute to Luna as well.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of extremes. My first manager. Luna died in the night of the two moons. Very unique, just like she. A strong woman.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels gave the following comment: "Luna was just as crazy as I was... maybe even crazier... I love her and I will miss her... hopefully she is in a better place.
From the 1,400 people who were surveyed in the run-up to the federal elections in 2010, the percentage of those who oppose Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The temporary acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the election campaign for the federal election in 2010, that she thought Australia would end up as a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of respondents share this view and want that Elizabeth II. is the last Australian monarch.
29 percent of those surveyed said Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent said Australia should never become a republic.
The gold medal winner at the Olympic Games should swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three-person relays at the Commonwealth Games, but because of his many complaints his fitness was doubted.
He was not able to take the necessary medication to overcome his pain, as they are banned at the Commonwealth Games.
On 25 January, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer scientist at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Many people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software in February and on Tuesday it was announced.
Cosmic rays may have been a source of water supply for the Earth, together with organic matter that forms proteins and can enable life.
Cosmic comets collided with the earth many years ago, and scientists are hoping to gain insights into how planets, in particular the earth
Cuomo (53) took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumours as "political gossip and silliness.
It is speculated that he may be seeking the presidency in 2016.
NextGen is a system, which the FAA claims would allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology rather than the older technology based on ground radar to enable the air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport facilities will be established and the underground trains will not stop at Wembley. There are no parking or parking-and-ride facilities available at Wembley.
With the fear of transport problems growing, the likelihood of the game being played without the fans of the team grew.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the emergence of a new bird species on the ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and the Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species had developed within just two generations, although it had previously been assumed that this process took much longer due to the mating between an indigenous Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into a variety of forms. It can be rolled into tiny pieces.
It can be drawn into a thin thread which can be twisted and woven. It can be hammered or rolled into leaves.
It can be made thin enough to be used as a decorative cover for handwritten manuscripts called manuscript illuminations.
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator with red vinegar.
The carbonated beverage changes its color depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemicals.
Hydrogen ions are protons which have been stripped of their electrons (because hydrogen atoms consist
Mix the two powders together and then knead them together with clean, wet hands into a ball.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feel strange and form a protective layer.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had almost every house equipped with a flush toilet, which was connected to an
Wastewater systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia and China there were toilets. In Roman culture toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, which men and women visited in mixed company.
If you call someone who is thousands of miles away, use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back down.
The satellite was launched by a rocket into space. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and our view.
It is necessary to launch a gigantic rocket with a height of more than 100 feet to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in a way that is unbelievable. The greatest service it has given us is much easier and faster transport.
It has brought us the railway, the car and many other transport means.
In addition, there are medium-sized cats, which eat prey of medium size, from rabbits to elephants and deer.
Finally, there are many little cats (including free roaming cats) that eat far smaller prey animals such as insects, rodents, amphibians, reptiles and birds
The secret of her success is the niche concept, a special task which every cat has and which ensures that she does not compete with other cats.
Lions are the most social cats. They live in large groups, which are called 'herds'.
The herds consist of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and young.
Women usually have a close relationship with each other when they live in a large family with sisters and daughters.
Lion packs behave like wolf packs, animals that surprise lions in their behaviour and are equally deadly to their prey.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (if not particularly well), swim, long distance jump and with the fivefold power of a strong man pull.
The tiger is in the same family (genus) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger does not sound like the confident roar of the lion, but rather like a sentence of gruff, grumbling words.
Ocelots eat small animals. If they can, they will steal monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all animals that the ostrich hunts are much smaller than he is.
Scientists think that otters track prey (prey) with their olfactory senses and find it. They sniff it, where they have been.
You can see in the dark very well and move unseen. Oyster divers hunt their prey by matching their environment and then attacking their prey.
If a small group of animals (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it comes (for example, if they move over a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island, so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so that the new population needs different characteristics or adaptations in order to be a strong competitor than what it used to need.
The original population has not changed at all. It still needs the same adaptations as before.
As time goes by, the new population adapts to its new environment, and then it looks less and less like the other population.
After thousands or millions of years, two populations will look so different that they will no longer be considered of the same species.
This process is called specialization, which simply means the emergence of new species.
Plants generate oxygen, which humans inhale, and they take carbon dioxide out of the air, which humans exhale (which is to say, exhale).
Plants produce their food by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses out of plants and make clothes out of plants. We eat mainly plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the largest predator of its time, so it feared nothing but other Mosasaurs.
His long jaws were equipped with more than 70 sharp teeth, including a further set on the tongue, which meant that there was no escape for any animal that crossed its path.
We do not know for sure, but he may have had a hooked tongue. He ate fish, large fish, other Mosasaurs and may even have been a cannibal.
He took everything in, even a great dinosaur like the T. Rex was not big enough for him.
While most of their food is known to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual meals, including wild boar, peacock, snails and a kind of frog called the seven-headed frog.
Another difference was that the poor people ate their food on chairs, while the rich men preferred to hold banquets where they sat on the side, while they ate their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not contain foodstuffs that came from America or Asia in later centuries.
They had no wheat, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no Romans have ever eaten a turkey.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a temple, which was regarded as the house of the god.
Man offered sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to comply with the wishes of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had a public temple and then an inner sanctum, which only priests were permitted to enter.
Sometimes special pyramidal temples were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East houses did not have such a great significance.
The majority of the life of the Hebrew family was played out in the open air.
The women cooked in the courtyard. Businesses simply consisted of open shop windows. To build a house, stone was used.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so that wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely settled. In the old Norse legends, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland because of murder. When he travelled further west, he found Greenland and gave it the name Greenland.
But regardless of its discovery, Eskimo people lived there already at that time.
Although all the countries were 'Nordic', there were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland." #
If you have seen the film 'The Last Legion', you may think that on the reverse of the Declaration of Independence there was drawn a treasure map.
That is not true. Although on the reverse of the document there is written something, it is not a treasure map.
On the reverse side of the declaration, the words 'original declaration of independence, dated 4 July 1776' were written.
Whether or not it was written by someone, it is known that the great scroll (which measures 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up at the beginning of its life to be kept in a scroll-roll.
It is possible that the mark simply was added as a label.
The landing on D-Day and the subsequent battles freed the North of France, but the South was still not free.
He was controlled by the "Vichy"" French. These were Frenchmen who, in 1940, made peace with the Germans and worked with the occupiers, rather than fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies landed in southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the French liberated the south of France and turned their attention to Germany.
A civilization is a culture that is shared by a significant number of people who live together and work, a society.
The word civilisation comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city state and also somehow defines the size of a society.
Cities are the forerunners of nations. A civilised culture implies the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint and a proper dissemination.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving any significant historical traces and fail to be recognised as genuine civilisations.
While the revolutions were raging the 13 states formed on the basis of the Federal Treaty first a weak central government, consisting of the Congress.
The Congress was not empowered to levy taxes, and there was no national executive or judicial authority, so it relied on the authorities of the states, which often did not cooperate.
He had no authority to suspend tax laws and duties between States.
The articles required unanimous consent of all States before they could be changed, and the States took the Central Government so little seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world and was the 2006 FIFA World Champion.
Favourite sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 motor racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions and Italians take part in international competitions and Olympic Games.
Japan has approximately 7,700 islands (of which Honshu is the largest), making it the seventh largest island in the world.
Because of the archipelago/group of islands, Japan is often referred to as an archipelago.
The beginning of Taiwan goes back to the 15th century, when European sailors passed by and recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
1624 the Dutch East India Company establishes a branch in the southwest of Taiwan, which initiates a change in the cultivation methods of the indigenous peoples and employs Chinese labourers on their rice and sugar plantations." #
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan and declared it a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
The Qing dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War, in which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is mainly made up of three buildings, namely the Intihuatana, the sun temple and the room of the three windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex were rebuilt to give visitors a better idea of how they looked originally.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored, and the restoration work continues to this day.
For example, 35 mm is the most widely used format worldwide, which corresponds to the final film format of the analogue era.
It is still made, but it is more important that its image format has been taken over by digital camera sensor formats.
In fact, the 35-mm-format is confusingly 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore referred to as 3:2.
Many of the usual formats (the APS format family, for example) have exactly the same or very similar aspect ratio.
The much-maligned and often mocked third-rail rule is a simple directive that creates dynamism and at the same time preserves order in a picture.
It states that the intersection of the lines that divide a picture vertically and horizontally is the most effective place for the main motif (see example)." #
In this period of European history, the Catholic Church stood on the test.
Since more than a thousand years, Christianity has kept the European states united despite different languages and customs.
His omnipotence ruled over everyone, from the king to the common man.
One of the most important Christian beliefs is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty.
The central authority of the Church was in Rome for more than a thousand years. This concentration of power and money had many to doubt whether this principle was upheld.
In the immediate aftermath of fighting initiated by Great Britain, Germany was blockaded by the British.
The strategy proved effective, as it cut off vital military and civilian supplies from the country, despite this blockade being contrary to the generally accepted principles of international law, which were codified in several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from penetrating whole oceanic areas, which was a threat to neutral ships as well.
The response to this tactic was limited, and Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted U-boat warfare.
In the 1920s pacifism and isolation were the dominant attitudes of most citizens and countries.
After the horrors of the First World War, the nations wanted to avoid another such situation in the future.
1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the United States with just 4 cents in his pocket, with a book of poems and a recommendation letter from Charles Batchelor (his previous employer) to Thomas Edison.
The old China had a unique way of showing different eras. Each era in China and each family in power was a separate dynasty.
In the course of the dynastic periods there were also unstable periods of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the period of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and the
In these times, there were bitter wars among many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The time of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died in the struggle for the highest throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a rejection of absolutism towards republicanism and nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a ruler alone.
Even after the revolution, all professions were open to all male candidates, so that the most ambitious and best succeeded.
The same applies to the military, for the ranks were based on the caliber rather than on class membership.
The French Revolution inspired many under-privileged people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed was very interested in things that went beyond the everyday life. He often visited a cave called Hira, which was known as Nur on the mountain of Nur (Light). He would meditate there.
The cave itself has survived the times and offers a lively picture of Mohammed's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It is not easy to find, even if you know that it exists. Once you are in the cave, you are completely isolated.
You can see nothing but the clear sky above and the numerous surrounding mountains. From the inside of the cave, very little of this world can be seen or heard.
The Cheops Pyramid is the only wonder of the seven that still stands.
The Cheops Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., it is one of many great pyramid structures built to honour the dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau or the 'Gizeh Necropolis' in Egypt comprises several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples and the Great Sp
The great pyramid was built in honour of the Pharaoh Cheops and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honour of his wives and family members.
The "spread" symbol looks like a V and the "stretch" symbol looks like a square, with the lower line missing.
Up means that you start at the top and pull the bow.
The erasing produces a softer sound, while the erasing produces a stronger and more expressive sound.
You are free to add your own pencil marks; however, remember that the printed lines are there for musical reasons, so they should be respected.
The terrified King Louis XIV, Queen Marie-Antoinette, her two small children (Marie-Thérèse, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old) as well as the sister of the King, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris by a mob of market women on 6 October 1789.
They travelled in a carriage back to Paris, surrounded by a mob of people who threatened the King and the Queen with violence.
The mob forced King and Queen to open their carriages' windows.
Sometime later, a member of the angry mob turned his head in front of the shocked queen of Versailles.
The expenditures of the US imperialists in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the US, to cover the bulk of the expenditure, and the interest on the bonds flowed through the banks of Wall Street in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the superprofits that emanated from the continual exploitation of the Filipino people were the basic profits of the US imperialist system.
To understand the Templars, one has to understand the context in which they were founded.
The period in which the events took place is generally referred to as the Middle Ages, a period in European history that extends over the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000–1300 A.D.).
The high middle ages preceded the late middle ages, which coincided with the end of the 15th century.
Technological determinism is a concept that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technology push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that the human fate is determined by a fundamental logic that is linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
The most common interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas. On the one hand, that the development of technology is a process which is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and on the other hand, that technology itself has effects on societies which are more intrinsic than socially determined.
It is possible to say that the motor vehicle is the inevitable consequence of the development of roads.
However, a national road network for only a small number of cars is economically not sustainable. Consequently, new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The widespread ownership of cars also leads to an increase in road accidents, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques in the health sector to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a strong, cultural deterministic element, which was drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography formed individuals. Over time, customs and cultures developed with reference to this geography and these, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
So as Paris is today known as the fashion capital of the world, so was Constantinople known as the fashion capital of the empire.
His fame as the epicentre of luxury began about 400 B.C. and lasted until about 1100 A. D.
His status declined in the twelfth century, mainly because the Crusaders with gifts such as silk and spices returned, which were regarded as more valuable than the offerings of the Byzantine markets.
At this time, the title of the world's fashion capital was also transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and the 14th centuries.
At the beginning, the clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantium's culture in the East.
In fact, the styles in the West are 25 to 30 years behind the rest of the world in terms of the slow communication channels.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop a distinctive style. One of the most important developments of the time was the fact that people began to use buttons to fasten their clothing.
Agriculture is agriculture that is aimed at producing as many food products as possible so that they meet the needs of the farmer or the farmer's family.
The subsistence economy is a simple, often biological cultivation method, which uses surplus, locally-grown seed, and uses rotational farming or other simple techniques to maximise yield.
In the past, most farmers practised subsistence farming and in many developing countries it is still the case.
Subcultures bring together people who feel neglected by social norms, and enable them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be differentiated in terms of age, ethnicity, class, place and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as such can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual or geographical.
Subcultures often signal their membership by a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits and jargon.
One of the most common ways of illustrating the importance of socialisation is to rely on the few unfortunate cases of children who have not been socialised by adults because of neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse during their childhood.
Those children are called "wild" or "wild." Some wild children were kept by people (usually the parents themselves); in some cases, the neglect of the child was due to the inability of the parents to accept the severe intellectual or physical limitations of the child.
Wolf cubs may have suffered severe child abuse or suffered traumatic experiences before they were abandoned or escaped.
Others have been raised on animals; some have lived alone in the wild.
If the child has been raised entirely by animals, it displays behaviours (in the context of its physical capabilities) that are almost completely in accordance with those of its specific carer, such as its fear or indifference to people.
While project-based learning should make learning more interesting and easier, the "scaffolding" approach goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but rather a support that helps individuals in a new learning situation, such as when they are using a new computer program or when they are starting a new
Framework can be virtual as well as real. In other words, a teacher is a form of framework, but also the little office stapler man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual assistance is built into the software and should question the steps that the student alone may not be able to complete, suggest alternatives and explain them.
Children are placed in foster homes for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse, exploitation and extortion.
No child should have to grow up in a environment that is not caring, loving and educationally oriented, but many are forced to do so.
For us, the care home is a piece of security for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe, loving home, caring parents, a stable education and a reliable health care.
The foster home will cover all the needs that they had not been able to meet in the home from which they had been removed.
The Internet connects both elements of mass communication, as well as interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in respect of the benefit-cost approach.
For example, learning and socialisation are cited as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
(LT) Personal engagement and sustained relationships were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied the audience reactions to websites.
Video recordings led to important insights into the interpretation of microexpressions, short-lived facial movements.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect lies by deducing the slightest changes in facial expression.
In his article, President Oliver Sacks showed how people with a brain injury can still correctly assess the honesty of people.
He even claims that the ability to interpret human behaviour may be shared with animals such as dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation results in new genetic variants and selection removes these from the pool of expressed variants.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with each generation in and out.
Out in the savannah, it is very difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of a human to meet his nutritional needs from available plant-based sources.
In addition, it has serious consequences if you do not take action: depression, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most accessible plant resources would have been proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are not digestible for primates like us, unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal food sources (bees, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide large quantities of proteins which contain all essential amino acids.
In general, it should not surprise us if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way as chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep regression is the process of goal-directed waking during normal sleep periods and the gradual falling into sleep shortly after waking.
This can be achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without completely waking you up.
If you are someone who imagines the alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room so that you have to leave the bed to turn it off.
Another way of doing it is to drink a lot of water before going to bed, so that you have to get up to go to the toilet.
The degree of inner calm that a person has is inversely related to the degree of tension in the body and mind.
Sadly, the less tension there is, the more positive is the potential of the person's life force. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can attain enlightenment. The only obstacle to this is our own strain and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded to include the path of love of the Mahayana and numerous techniques of Indian yoga." #
In principle, the Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (awakening energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The centre of Tibetan meditation is the god-yoga. By visualising various gods, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are opened and the enlightened consciousness a
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, which led to a cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war, the collision of the systems, the course and the culture led to the fact that the countries fought each other.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the cold war began.
He should last for the next 40 years and be carried out in the real world by proxy armies in Africa, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defence had already collapsed completely and the only hope lay in a retreat and a reorganisation along the Romanian bridgehead.
The plans were, however, almost obsolete overnight when over 800,000 Red Army soldiers invaded the white and Ukrainian fronts and created these after they invaded the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Yalta agreements, the non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Poland and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is the most efficient means of transporting large human and goods masses over the seas.
The task of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that a country is able to carry out the transport of people and goods and at the same time to hinder the enemy's ability to do so.
One of the most important recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans tried to bring personnel and material to the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to prevent this traffic mainly by submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain exactly as the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were domesticated in the Zagros Mountains in Iran around 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and peoples began to keep them as livestock to get easily at their milk, fur, meat and skin.
Sheep were usually kept in herds, which wandered on hills or other pasture areas. They were cared for by shepherds, just like the more familiar sheepherders; often were they children or adolescents. This grazing system is still used
In the 16th century, people in England built uplifts.
Although the railway tracks consisted of only parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to travel faster and carry heavier loads than on the rougher roads of the time.
As early as the beginning of the century, barriers were introduced to ensure the position of the railway. Gradually, however, it became apparent that railways carrying a railway track were more efficient.
This was customary, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron railway was introduced.
The first known mode of transport was walking. Man began walking about two million years ago with the appearance of the Homo erectus (which means "standing man").
Your predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not go on a regular basis.
Two-footed species are found in Australopithecus fossils from about 4,2 to 3,9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to help alleviate future suffering a little.
It is in many cases only a symptomatic treatment. If you want to deal with the root of the problem, then you should find a solution and treat it.
It is plainly obvious that the world has changed due to the scientific and technological advances of mankind and that the problems caused by overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles of people have become more serious.
After its adoption by the Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by the Congress President John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to the printer John Dunlap.
In the course of the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are known as "Dunlap broadsides" today.
The first reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the Independence Hall on 8 July.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that are still extant are the oldest still extant copies of the document. The original handwriting has not survived the
Many paleontologists now believe that there is a group of dinosaurs that have survived and still exist today. They are called birds.
Many see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and fly.
But many things about birds still look like dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and run on both hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
Every computer used today is based on the processing of information in binary form.
A binary number can only have one of two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, to use the computer jargon.
A toxic internal poisoning can be difficult to diagnose. The symptoms, for example vomiting, are so general that one cannot immediately make a diagnosis.
The best evidence for a poisoning by ingestion is the presence of an open container of medicines or toxic household chemicals.
Look at the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison.
The term 'wade' is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this insect group.
This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs. These insects are very adaptable to parasitizing people.
Ragweeds as well as bedbugs are nidicolous, that is to say adapted to live in their nests or in the homes of their hosts.
In the United States there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which is the most common neurological disease among adults aged between 20 and 40.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and the peripheral nerves.
Studies have shown that women are four times more likely to develop MS than men.
A couple can decide that it is not in their own interest or in the interest of their child to have a baby.
These couples can choose to adopt a child.
When a child is adopted, the biological parents give up their parental rights, so that another couple can take on the parental responsibilities.
The main aim of science is to discover how the world works. This method is in fact the basis of most scientific investigations.
But it is not only about experimentation, where an experiment is a test to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also guided by the setting of questions and the conduct of observations.
Natural scientists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts and in particular on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were widely accepted.
With the loss of Greek language skills, Western civilization was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behaviour are often based on the presence of body-specific rhythms and their production by biological clocks.
A cycle of behaviours that are not only responses to external cycles, but are also known in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that even in the absence of external signals continue to oscillate in free-swinging cycles.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the most important evidences that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacteria.
They took two experiments into account, in which either the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphor or a protein in the phage was marked with radioactive phosphor or radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the relevant piece of genetic material, and whether it is a germline cell.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cancer or death.
Nature-based tourism draws people who are interested in visiting natural areas, to enjoy the landscape, including the wild plants and animals.
Exemples of activities on the ground are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
An example of this is the visit, the photographing and the studying of orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave small provincial towns with their cars to go to their workplace and are passed by others whose workplace is the place they just left.
In this dynamic transport pendulum, all are connected to a transport system based on private cars and supported by it.
Now, science has pointed out that this massive carbon economy has brought the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone takes part in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
You will rarely hear complaints about the water quality or the collapse of bridges in developed countries.
Why do transport systems fail so often? Why are transport engineers incompetent? Or is something fundamentally wrong going on here?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
It is difficult to study traffic flows, because one cannot predict driver behaviour with a hundred percent certainty.
Thankfully, drivers tend to behave reasonably consistently; therefore, traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be mathematically described." #
To better represent the flow of traffic, the relationships between the three main characteristics were defined: (1) river, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of facilities on the road.
Bees were the first animals to conquer the skies. Their ability to fly helped them to evade enemies more easily and to find more efficient food and mates.
Most insects can fold their wings along their bodies.
They have a wider range of small holes in which they can hide themselves from predators.
Today, butterflies and moths are the only insects that can fly without folding their wings.
In the distant past, a man named Aristarch claimed that the sun was at the centre of the movements of the solar system.
Many people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system including the sun (and even the other stars) move around the earth.
It seems reasonable, because it does not seem to you as if the earth moved?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the most water-rich river in the world. It flows more than eight times as much water as the second largest
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, with a width of up to six miles.
 Twenty percent of the water that flows through rivers on the planet goes to the oceans.
The Amazon main river is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It takes water from thousands of smaller rivers into it.
While the construction of pyramids of stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Pyramids of Gizeh never surpassed their size and the technical perfection of their construction.
Egyptians in the ancient New Kingdom marvelled at the monuments of their forefathers, which were thousands of years old at the time.
Vatican City has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the smallest population country.
The Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the language of most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known to mankind for thousands of years, since these can all be found in their original form in nature and can be extracted with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, posited the theory that all things are made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This corresponded more to the four states of aggregation (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma. He also posited the theory that they would change into new substances to form what we see.
League is a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are regarded as metals. Of course there are other metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys which contain very small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
The universe is made up of matter in its entirety. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that billions of them would fit in the end of this sentence.
So, therefore, the pencil was a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, the pencil has been pushed into the background by the introduction of new writing methods, so that it has been pushed back in its status and in its use
Today, people write news on computer screens, without ever having to get close to a rocket launcher.
I am also curious to see what will come out of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The atomic bomb is based on the principle that energy is required to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like if you were to roll a heavy car up a hill. If the core is split, some of this energy will be released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they can decay even at very low or no activation.
The surface of the moon consists of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The outer layer is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the sea and thicker under the highlands.
On the near side, there could be more Maria, since the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what people are moved by or interested in.
This theory suggests that people have certain needs and/or wishes that are acquired during their adulthood.
The theories concern what certain people are motivated to want, and what influences in their environment cause them to want certain things to do or not to do.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
There are two possible patterns of behaviour when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the boys" (or of the girls).
This kind of manager has problems in making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary measures, making performance appraisals, assigning responsibility and enforcing disciplinary measures.
At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable individual who has to change everything as the team has done and takes everything into his own hands.
In the end, the manager of the team is responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behaviour often leads to friction between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are led in the same way as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members have often the function of a contact point for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, since their teams meet in different time zones, which may not be taken into account by the local management.
The presence of a truly invisible team (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also an unique component of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the leadership team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organisation take the time and effort to introduce an organisational learning concept? A goal for the practical implementation of organisational learning concepts is innovation.
If all available resources are effectively used across all departments of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can arise.
In the end, the common work of an organisation can lead to a new innovative procedure that takes into account the customer's need.
Before an organisation can be innovative, the leadership must develop a culture of innovation and shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the concept of the continuum as a method to help organisations become more efficient.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. This limits the research field and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that various types of brain damage, such as trauma, injuries and tumours, influence the behaviour and cause changes in some brain functions.
New technologies allow us to see certain brain structures and processes for the first time.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that will help us understand the processes in our heads.
KI is not only strongly associated with science fiction, but is also a key branch of computer science, which deals with behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in the field of KI includes the manufacture of machines for automating tasks that require intelligent behaviour.
Exemples of this are control, the setting of strategies and timetables, the ability to answer customer questions and diagnoses, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Things like these have become independent disciplines, which are focused on finding solutions for the real problems of life.
The computer-based intelligence system is now used in many areas of industry, medicine, engineering and military and is also incorporated in many software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of every school. Often a teacher would like to take her pupils to places where a bus journey is not possible.
Virtual field trips are a technical solution. Pupils can view museum objects, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful art works from their classroom.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and to share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennett School in North Carolina design each year a website about their trip to Washington, D.C. The website is updated each year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a collection album.
Blogs can also help improve the writing skills of students. Although students at the beginning of their blog experience often have a sloppy grammar and spelling, this usually changes as a result of a readership.
Students are often very critical audiences, so the blogger tries to improve his writing style to avoid criticism.
The blogging forces the students to learn more about the world around them. The need to attract the attention of the public inspires the students to write intelligently and interestingly (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to continue learning outside the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can help students to become more analytical and critical; by responding to Internet material, students can define their positions in the context of texts of others and present their own perspectives on particular topics.
Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital of Canada and it is home to a number of art galleries and museums that present Canada's past and
In the South are the Niagara Falls, and in the North is the untouched beauty of nature in Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and other things make Ontario unique as what is considered typical of Canada by outsiders.
A large part of the North is sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that many surprises: There are more African Americans in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The islands in the Indian Ocean off the African coast are located.
Madagaskar is the largest and, as far as the animal world is concerned, a separate continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or attached to France and are known as luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to the islands and it was very successful there.
The European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
The North is bounded by the Sahel zone and in the South and West by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travellers should make a declaration of marital status, irrespective of their actual marital status.
Also wearing a ring is helpful (don't wear a ring that looks too expensive.
Women should recognise that cultural differences can lead to what they perceive as an assault, and that it is not uncommon to be followed, handcuffed, etc.
Keep your consistency when you reject men, and don't be afraid to defend your position (cultural differences aside; that doesn't mean that it's okay!)
Today's Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Merinides as a strategic port with the name Anfa." #
The Portuguese destroyed them and rebuilt them under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon them after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan built the city as Dar el Beida again and it was called Casablanca by Spanish traders who established their trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
It is easy to find places where traditional Moroccan goods such as Tagines, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of tinned food are sold, but that is all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the extreme east near Rwanda.
In 2002 the city of Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city, especially the city centre.
While Goma is relatively safe, it is important to plan your stay outside Goma carefully, in order to learn about the ongoing fighting in the North Kivu province." #
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of the Nyiragongo volcano and for some of the cheapest gorilla tracking tours in Africa.
You can use Bodabodas (motorbike taxis) to get around Goma. The usual (local) fare is about FRF 500 for a short
This in combination with its relative remoteness has made "Timbuktu" a metaphor for exotic, far-away countries.
Although Timbuktu is a tourist attraction and has a airport, it is today a poor city.
In 1990, the threat of sandstorms was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger.
It was one of the most important stops on Louis Gates' PBS special "Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the cities of the country, because it is more of an Arab than an African ambiance.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the north-eastern corner of South Africa. It borders in the east with Mozambique, in the north with Zimbabwe and in
The park has an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecosystems, each of which supports a different animal species.
He is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is regarded as the symbol of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As all South African national parks, the park charges daily entry fees.
It can also be worthwhile to buy a wild card, which gives access either to selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the namesake of the territory of Hong Kong and is the focus of many tourists' attention.
The buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong are compared to a shimmering bar chart that is visible through the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best prospects of Hong Kong, you should leave the island and drive to the opposite bank of Kowloon.
The majority of the city-building of Hong Kong Island is concentrated along the newly acquired land along the north coast.
This is the place that the British colonists have taken over. If you look for traces of colonial history in the area, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forest in the world and extend over 80 km from the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland to the coast.
The Sundarbans were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is referred to as Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not only mangrove swamps – they also encompass some of the last remaining remnants of the mighty jungle that once covered the Ganges
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which a third is covered by water and marshes.
The Sundarbans are a nature reserve since 1966, and estimates show that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and up to 30,000 spotted deer there.
Buses run all day long from the district-wide bus station (on the other side of the river) and, apart from the buses heading east and west towards Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30 a
It is advisable to buy a ticket in advance for the buses between the districts.
Most districts will be by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
Taxi-hailing services are a fast and comfortable way to get to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a curved cable bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges
The two towers are 83 metres high, their length is 378 metres and they have two lanes with 3,50 m width.
The bridge height is 15 metres. The construction work was completed in August 2011, but the opening of the bridge was delayed until March 2017.
The bridge will be operational in September 2017. It is expected that the Brazilian customs checkpoints will be completed then.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group that inhabited the present-day Paraguayan eastern region. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters
The Chaco region was also home to other indigenous groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing
Paraguay was formerly known as the Gran Província de West Indies, and was formed as a result of the Spanish conquest of the native Indian groups
The Spaniards began the colonization period, which lasted for three centuries.
Asunción 1537 has been able to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentinian polo teams and players are renowned for their excellence.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at Las Cañitas Polo fields.
Small tournaments and competitions can be watched here at other times of the year.
Informations on polo competitions and polo ticket outlets can be found at the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is set in accordance with the value of the British Pound
Money can be exchanged in the only bank on the island that is located opposite the FIC West Store.
The pound will generally be accepted everywhere on the islands and at Stanley credit cards. Also US dollars are often accepted.
On the remote islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, but British and American currency can be accepted; ask the owners in advance which payment method is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland Islands' currency outside the islands themselves, so you should exchange your money before you leave the island.
As Montevideo is situated south of the equator, it is there summer when it is winter in the northern hemisphere.
Montevideo is in the tropics. In the summer months, temperatures can reach 30°C.
The winter can be misleadingly cold: the temperatures rarely fall below freezing point, but wind and humidity lead to a feeling of colder than the temperature on the thermometer.
There are no distinct wet and dry seasons: The amount of precipitation remains constant over the whole year.
Although many of the animals in the park have seen people before, they are still wild animals and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the instructions of the park authority, visitors should keep at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals.
Even if Bisons, Wapitis, Elches, Bears and all the big animals look peaceful, it can still happen that they turn into attackers.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not take enough space. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so leave them enough space.
Be aware that odours attract bears and other wild animals. Avoid carrying strong odour foods with you or cooking them, and be careful to keep your camp clean.
Apia is the capital of the island of Upolu and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 18th century and is the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a shameful stalemate in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships except one British cruiser were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans died.
While the Mau movement was organising a peaceful demonstration in the city, a peaceful demonstration in the city led to the killing of the top leader Tupua Tamasese Lealo
There are many beaches in Auckland. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) lie on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south." #
Most of the beaches are sandy with safe bathing facilities and most offer shade from the Pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located at the port of Waitemata, in the upper suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Au
There are also family beaches, which are sometimes overcrowded, with a beautiful promenade along the coast. Swimming is here safe.
The most important local beer is "Number One". It is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is "Manta".
There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines are probably better tolerated.
Local tap water can be safely consumed, but if you are concerned, you will also find bottled water.
For Australians, the idea of coffee ""flat white"" is foreign. A small black coffee is ""espresso"" and a cappuccino is served with a lot of foam (not with milk) and tea
Hot chocolate is Belgian standard. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many trips to the reef take place all through the year and breaches of any of the causes of the reef are rare.
However, you should follow the Council of authorities, all signs and especially pay attention to security warnings.
Shrimps are common in the vicinity of beaches and in the vicinity of river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can also occur outside this period
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and would run away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live in the sea, their primary habitat is in river mouths north of Rockhampton.
A reservation in advance gives the traveller the assurance that he will have a place to stay when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although you may also book other accommodation, such as tents, through a travel agency.
Travel agents usually offer packages in which breakfast, transport to and from the airport or even a combination of flight and hotel are included.
You can also hold your reservation for you if you need time to reconsider or to obtain further documents for your travel destination (e. g. visa).
Any changes or requests should, however, first be directed to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
Many festivalgoers decide to camp out at the festival and most visitors believe this to be an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you have to get there early to get a campsite close to the music.
Remember that there is still music playing on parts of the festival until very late at night, even though the main stages have stopped playing.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the North Sea in winter, check the state of the cabin, as the breaking of ice can be quite horrendous for the most affected.
Cruise ships also offer time for a stay in St. Petersburg. Passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos generally try very hard to keep guests there as long as possible and to spend a lot of money on them. There are usually no windows or watches, and exits are sometimes difficult to find.
You usually have a special offer for food, drinks and entertainment to keep the guests entertained and to ensure that they stay.
Some venues offer alcoholic beverages free of charge. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good players know how important it is to remain sober.
If you want to drive over high altitudes or over mountain passes, you should be prepared for snow, ice and temperatures below freezing.
On icy and snowy roads, the liability is low and you can't drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
In very short time, so much snow can fall that you can get stuck.
The visibility can also be affected by falling snow or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, cold and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and the traffic runs all year round largely uninterrupted.
Safaris are probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
Safari is a term used in the usual jargon to describe a trip to see the overwhelming wildlife of Africa, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars, and the standard equipment enables a good view.
Lion, leopard and cheetah are often timid and you can observe them better with a telescope.
A bushwalk is a walk that lasts for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will take place at other venues in all Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Olympic Summer Games after it has already hosted the Games in 1964.
If you have booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the rescheduling was announced, you could end up in a difficult situation.
The cancellation guidelines vary, but from mid-March most cancellation guidelines were not valid until July 2020, for the Olympic Games that were planned.
It is estimated that most tickets will cost between 2500¥ and 130,000¥, a typical ticket will cost around 7000¥.
Washing your clothes can help dry them. Many hotels provide irons and ironing boards, even if you are not present in the room.
If no iron is available or you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer if one is available.
Be careful not to overheat the material (it can shrink it or in extreme cases lead to burns).
There are various methods for cleaning water. Some of them are more effective than others to deal with certain threats.
In some areas it is enough to boil water for a minute, in others it may be several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies greatly, and if you have any concerns, then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers can encounter animal pests that they do not know from their home regions.
Infestation can destroy food, cause irritation or even cause allergic reactions, give poison or transmit diseases.
Infections as such or dangerous animals that can wound or kill people are usually not classified as vermin.
Tax-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from duties and taxes at certain places.
Travellers who have a destination country with a high tax rate can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, particularly in the case of alcoholic beverages and to
The section between Point Marion and Fairmount on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway is the most challenging driving section, as it often leads through remote, undeveloped countryside.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: steep gradients, narrow roads and sharp bends predominate here.
The speed limits specified here are noticeably lower than in the previous and following sections - usually between 35 and 40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and their strict enforcement is even more important than usual." #
But interestingly, the mobile phone coverage here is much better than in many other areas of the route, for example, the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German bread is very tasty. In Bavaria, it is very rich and varied, as well as in Austria.
Pasta is very widespread, with apples being cooked all year round and plums and cherries being used in summer.
Mandeln, Haselnüsse, Walnüsse und andere Nüsse sind in vielen deutschen Backwaren enthalten. Viele Kuchen passen besonders gut zu einer Tasse starken
If you want to produce small but rich baked goods, then try this, which is called in different regions as Berliner, pancakes or crepes.
A curry is a dish that is based on herbs and spices, with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either dry or wet.
In the interior of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and in some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is
With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a catch-all term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines that can be found throughout the country
When the term is used without any further attributes, it usually refers to the food that originates from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine, which is now widely spread throughout the archipelago, offers a large variety of simple spiced dishes. As flavouring agents, the Javans prefer nuts, chilis, sugar (especially javan coconut sugar) and a number of aromati
Stitching is a kind of aid for the feet of the riders, which hang down from both sides of the saddle.
You give the horse more stability, but there are security concerns because the feet of the horse may get caught in them.
If a rider falls off his horse and gets caught on the stirrup, he can be pulled along if the horse passes. To minimise this risk, a number of precautions can be taken.
Firstly, the majority of the horses wear shoes with a heel and a smooth, narrow sole.
In addition, some saddles, in particular English saddles, have safety buckles which allow a saddle to fall when it is pulled back by a falling rider.
The Cochamó Valley – Chile’s most important climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a number of large granite walls and cliffs.
The summits offer a spectacular view. Climbers from all over the world discover new routes along the walls, which offer endless possibilities.
Skiing and snowboarding are popular sports, in which skis or snowboards are attached to your feet and you descend a slope on a snow covered surface.
Skiing is a popular holiday activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as'ski-bunnies', who plan their entire holiday around the skiing at a particular place.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depicting skiers go back to 5000 BC!
The origins of skiing as a sport go back at least to the 17th century and in 1861 the first ski club in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Backpacking with a backpack: This activity is also known as skiing or skiing.
It resembles alpine skiing or mountaineering, but it does not necessarily include it, since it is carried out in steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis
Look at the ski route as a comparable hiking route.
If you are in good health, you can cover a greater distance than you would on a walking holiday - only very rarely will you be able to cover the speed of a skiing holiday without a heavy pack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries. Normally you would have to apply for multiple visas and go through multiple passport controls if you wanted to travel through several countries.
The Schengen area works in this respect however a little like a country.
As long as you remain in this zone, you can usually cross the border without having to go through the passport control again.
In accordance with this, you do not have to apply for a Schengen visa for each of the Schengen states individually, which saves time, money and
There is no universally accepted definition of what constitutes an antique. Some tax authorities define over 100 years old goods as antiquities.
The definition is geographically differentiated, in which case the age limit may be lower in regions such as North America.
Handmade products could be described as 'antique', although they are younger than similar products produced in mass production.
The reindeer breeding industry is a major source of livelihood for the Sámi, and the culture around the trade is also of great importance for many who work in other professions.
In the past, not all Sámi have bred large numbers of reindeer, but have lived on agriculture, hunting and fishing. They kept reindeer mainly as draught animals.
Many Sámi work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.

Flooding is the umbrella term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, social disruption or loss of life.
Floods can occur anywhere in the world and there are different types of floods, depending on geography, topography and the atmosphere.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall and forest fires are forms and effects of weather, as are storms, tornados, waterspouts
Regional and seasonal weather phenomena are, for example, blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
Travellers are urged to be on the lookout for any type of weather that affects their area, as this will have a knock-on effect on all
Everyone planning to travel to a country that is a war zone should have a professional training for that purpose.
A search for ""course on hostile environments"" will probably show the address of a local company.
A course covers the whole range of problems discussed here usually much more comprehensively, usually in combination with practical experience.

There are many books and journals on survival in the wilderness, but very few publications on conflict zones.
Travellers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure that they have valid travel documents for their return.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with a non-specified gender (X) or documents that have been updated to reflect the desired name and gender is different.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognise these documents is also very different.
The searches at security checks have become more intrusive since 11 September 2001.
Transgender people should not expect that their privacy and dignity will be respected when they pass through the scanners.
Riss currents are the return current of broken waves, often at reefs or similar.
Because of the underwater topology, the return flow concentrates in a few deeper areas and a rapid current can form there.
The majority of deaths occur when people try to swim against the current, which can prove to be impossible.
When one gets out of the current, it is not difficult to get back into it.
If you can get somewhere, where you are not caught, try to get somewhere, where you are not noticed, or you could wait for rescue.
The shock of return is earlier than the shock of culture shock (the honeymoon phase is not as intense), lasts longer and is more serious.
Travellers who were able to adapt themselves to the new culture find it difficult to adapt themselves to their own culture.
When you come back from a foreign trip you have adapted to a different culture and have abandoned some of the customs of your home culture.
When you first travelled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding because they knew that travellers had to adapt to a new country.
I am not sure that we expect to be treated with patience and understanding by returning travellers.
The sound and light show at the Pyramids is one of the most interesting attractions for children in the area.
You can see the Pyramids in the dark and while it is still quiet before the show begins.

The mountains of the peninsula rise here and then divide the 360 km long chain of Ellsworth mountains, which is divided into two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak is the Mount Vinson, at 4892 m.
In remote areas without mobile coverage, a satellite phone can be the only option.
A satellite phone is not a substitute for a mobile phone, as you have to be in clear sight of a satellite to make a call.
The service is often used by ships, including pleasure ships, and expeditions that require data and voice links.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with further information about the connection to this service.

Boating is the national pastime in Finland, one in six or eight owns a boat.
This is similar to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the ratio is one to fourty.)
Most cruises to the Baltic Sea are of a longer duration in St. Petersburg, Russia.
That means that you can visit the historic city for a whole day while you are back on board and sleeping in the cabin.
If you only go on a tour of the countryside, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
A few cruises offer Berlin as a destination in their brochures. You can see that Berlin is far from the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of a cruise.
Travelling by air can be a terrifying experience for people of any age and from any life-stage, especially if they have never travelled before or have had a traumatic experience behind them.
That is nothing else than the personal fears and antipathies that many people have.
To learn more about the workings of aircraft and the processes involved during a flight can help some to overcome their fear of the unknown or the feeling that they have no control over it.
Courier companies are paid well for the quick delivery of things. Often, time is a very important factor in business documents, trade goods or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the larger firms use their own aircraft, but on other routes and for smaller firms there were problems.
If they sent things via air freight, the loading and customs clearance could take several days on some routes.
The only way to get it done quicker was to send it as a baggage." The airlines’ rules do not allow you to send luggage without a passenger, and that’s where you come in.
The obvious way to fly in first or business class is to put a substantial amount of money on the line (or, better still, to force your own company to pay for the cost).
That is, however, not cheap: As a rough guide, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business and first class for the same flight!
It is pointless to look for discounts on direct flights from A to B even for business or first class seats.
The airlines know very well that there is a certain core group of pilots who are prepared to pay a lot of money to get to their destination quickly and comfortably, and demand appropriate prices.
The capital of Moldova is Kishinev. The native language is Romanian, but many people speak also Russian.
Moldova is a multiethnic state, which has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
The conflict in the Transnistrian Republic in the eastern part of Moldova in 1994 led to the creation of a self-proclaimed republic in Transnistria, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognised by any UN member state

When you visit monasteries, women must wear skirts that reach up to the knees and they must cover their shoulders.
In most monasteries there are no dresses for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one in bright colours, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you.
In addition, men must wear trousers that reach below the knees.
And these can be borrowed from the stock, but the clothes are not washed after each user, so you may not feel comfortable in these shirts.
