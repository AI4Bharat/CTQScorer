When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives a call and virtually instantaneously reflects it back down.
The satellite was launched by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the atmosphere of the Earth distorts our light and view.
To launch a satellite or telescope, you need a giant rocket that is 100 feet tall.
The wheel has changed our world. The most important thing that the wheel has done for us, is given us much more light and faster transportation.

Under them are more cats of medium size, which eat small game from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, many small cats (including walking domestic cats) eat and hunt on much larger animals, such as insects, rodents, snakes and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the concept of niche, a special job that each cat performs, which keeps it from competition with other cats.
The lions are the most social cats, living in large groups, which are called prides.
The herd consists of one to three adult males, which are related, as well as females and offspring, the number of which can reach thirty.
The females usually live together in close kinship and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lions herds behave very much like packs of wolves or dogs - animals that are so similar to lions (but not other large cats) and are also very dangerous for their prey.
Being a complete athlete, the tiger can climb trees (though not very well), swim, jump over great distances and pull with five strong men.
Tiger belongs to the same family (Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones who have the ability to roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the roar of a lion, but more like the utterance of sentences from unintelligible words.
Ocelot love to eat small animals. If an opportunity presents itself, they will catch monkeys, snakes, lizards and birds. Almost all animals, on which ocel
Researchers believe that the otters follow the trail of animals and find their prey by smell, tracking their movements on the ground.
They are able to see in the dark with night vision and almost undetectable move. Ocelot hunts by blending into the surroundings, then attacking the prey.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) separates from the main population from which they originated (for example, if they cross a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment from that in which they had previously been.
This new environment has other resources and other competitors, so the new population will need other characteristics or changes compared to those that it had before, to become a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed at all — it still needs the same adaptations as before.
As time goes by, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, it begins to look less and less like the rest of the population.
In time, through thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will look so different that it will be impossible to say that they are the same species.
We call this process the formation of species, which is the emergence of new species. Formation of species is an essential consequence and a very significant part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that breathes man and absorb carbon dioxide that man exhales.
The plants feed from the sun by photo synthesis. In addition, they cast shadows.
We build our houses and make clothes from plants. The vast majority of our food is plants. Without plants, animals would not have survived.

Cities-states are the precursors of nations. Civilizational culture implies the transmission of knowledge through several generations, the continual cultural presence and the transmission of the cultural legacy.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving any historical evidence, and so cannot be recognized as authentic civilizations.
In the American War of Independence, thirteen states, in accordance with Articles of Confederation, first formed a weak central government, the sole organ of which was the Congress.
The Congress lacked any authority to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial power, it relied on the powers of the states, who often refused to cooperate and not to enforce all its acts.
He also did not have the authority to annul the tax legislation and the tariffs of the states.
To amend the Articles, requires unanimous approval of all States, but States have so irresponsibly neglected the central government, that their representatives often did

For example, the most common format for static photographs is 35 mm, and this was the dominant size of film for the analog era.
It is still produced, but more important is that the ratio of the dimensions of the images of digital cameras have inherited.
The 35-mm format is a bit confusing, it has a width of 36 mm and a height of 24 mm.
The aspect ratio of this format is divided into two parts, so it is called 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. the APS family of formats) are close or equal to these proportions.
Too often used and often mocked by the rule of thirds is a simple recommendation that creates dynamism, while maintaining a certain degree of order in the image

In this period of European history, the Catholic Church, becoming rich and powerful, was the object of intense attention.
On more than thousand years Christianity united European states despite the differences in languages and traditions.
Her all-pervading power touched everyone - from the king to the common man.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to ease suffering and poverty, and that the church's money exists to this end.
The center of church authority was based in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth led to the fact that many doubted whether this doctrine is being observed.
As soon as hostilities began, Britain set up a naval blockade of Germany.
This strategy has proven its effectiveness, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated all-over the world international laws, laid down in several international agreements over the past two centuries

To understand the Templars, you need to understand the context in which they were created.
The period in which these events took place is called the High Middle Ages, a period of European history that covers the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages replaced the earlier Middle Ages and preceded the later Middle Ages, which, according to the accepted view, ended around 1500.
Technological determinism - is a term, covering a wide spectrum of practical and ideas, from technological progress or technological imperative to strict point of view that fates of people is driven by the fundamental logic, associated with laws of science and
Many views on technological determinism share two common ideas: that the direction of technological development is virtually uncontrollable by cultural or political influence and that, in turn, "influence" of technologies on society is determined by their own properties, not
For example, one could say that the automobile is an essential cause of road development.
However, the national road network is economically unfeasible only for a small group of cars, so new methods of production are being developed to reduce the cost of ownership of a car.
Mass ownership of cars also leads to an increase in the number of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new methods of treatment of the injuries received on the road.
Romanticism was largely influenced by cultural determinism, drawn from such writers as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography formed people, and over time, the customs and culture associated with the place of residence of this society were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Like Paris is called the capital of fashion of the modern world, so was Constantinople considered the capital of fashion in the times of feudal Europe.
His fame as a center of luxury spread around 400 BC and continued until 1100 BC.
His status was lowered during the 12th century mainly because of the Crusaders returning with such gifts as silk and spices, which were more valuable than the goods offered on the Byzantine markets.
This moment and occurred the transition of the title of the Capital of Fashion from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the X and XI centuries and the XIV century.
At first, clothing was under the strong influence of Byzantine culture on the east.
However, due to slow channels of communication, styles in the West may lag by 25-30 years.
Own styles began to develop in Western Europe at the end of the Middle Ages. One of the greatest achievements of that time was the use of buttons for fastening clothing.
NATURAL AGRICULTURE

Historically, most farmers were engaged in agriculture for subsistence, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded people who feel marginalised by society and allow them to define for themselves who they are.
There are differences between subcultures, due to age, nationality, social status, place of residence and/or sexual orientation of people from which it consists.
The characteristics that define a subculture as an individual, may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
Some subcultures often claim to be part of a certain style, including through a certain fashion, manners and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to illustrate several unfortunate cases when children were not able to contact with adults during their adulthood.
Wild children are called "wild" or "wild." Some wild children were isolated by people (usually their own parents). In some cases, such an abandonment of their child was the result of not accepting the parents' serious intellectual
Street children, it is possible that they have suffered from severe forms of violence or trauma before escaping or being abandoned.
Others, as is claimed, were raised by animals; some of them lived in the wild on their own.
If he has been brought up by animals instead of people, a wild child displays the habits (within physical limits) in almost all like the one that raised him — for example, his fear or indifference to people.
While project-based learning should be simpler and more interesting, flipped learning is ahead of many technologies.
Scaffling is not a method of teaching, but rather a form of support for those who are going through a new experience of learning, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffling can be either virtual or real. In other words, the teacher is a form of scaffling, but also it is the Screwy in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding, helping in learning, is embedded in the software and is intended to remind, explain and ask questions about procedures that may be too difficult for the learner to handle alone.
Children are often transferred to foster care for a variety of reasons: from being abandoned to being abused and even being

The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional scales in terms of approach to use and satisfaction.

In the savanna, the primates with such digestive systems as that of man, are difficult to meet their nutritional needs by means of the available plant resources." #
In addition, failure to do this will lead to such serious consequences as slow growth, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The most accessible plant resources would be proteins found in leaves and legumes, but they are poorly absorbed by such rodents as we are, if they are not
In contrast, animal origin food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest, but also provides a rich source of proteins, containing all the essential
Taking into account all that has been said, it is no wonder that our ancestors decided to "protein problem" approximately the same way that chimpanzees in the savanna are still
Sleep interruption is a process of intentional awakening during the normal sleep and subsequent re-sleeping within a short time (10–60 minutes).
It is easy to do this with a relatively quiet alarm clock so that you wake up and yet not completely wake up.

Other options based on biological rhythms include drinking large quantities of liquid (for example, water or tea, known diuretic) before going to bed, which forces the person to get up to urinate." #
The amount of inner peace of a person is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in his body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive the presence of life force within you. Everyone has the potential to attain absolute peace and a sense of satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negative attitude.

The use of ships for the transport of goods is, of course, the most effective way of transporting a large number of people and goods across oceans.
Work of seafarers traditionally consists in ensuring the ability of the country to move its people and goods, as well as simultaneously preventing the enemy from moving its people and goods.
One of the most interesting recent examples of this was the Atlantic Ocean during World War II. American forces attempted to transport people and materials through the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German naval fleet, using mainly its submarines, tried to stop this movement.
If the anti-Hitler coalition had failed, Germany, more than likely, could have conquered Britain as well as the other European countries.

Ancient cultures and tribes left them to themselves, so they had milk, wool, meat and skin.
Farmed goats are usually kept in herds that wandered around the hills or other pastures, over which the herders were usually children or teenagers, which is similar to the more common activity of a shepherd. These methods of grazing are still used today.
The roads for carriages were built in England in the 16th century.
These were not merely laid parallel to the logs, but gave horses the opportunity to transport larger loads and at a faster rate than on slightly more bumpy roads of the time.
Shovels were used quite a long time to hold rails in place. However, it became clear that the tracks were more effective when laid on a layer of iron.
This is now the accepted practice, but iron caused more wear on wooden wheels of wagons.
Over time, wooden wheels were replaced by iron. In 1767, the first rails were made entirely of iron.
The first known form of transport was walking, people began walking straight two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means straight man).
For their ancestors of the australopithecines, walking straight was not as common.
Bipedal specializations are found in the remains of australopithecines from the period of 4,2-3,9 million years ago, although, perhaps, the sahelanthropus walked on
We can start living, more concerned about the environment. We can become members of environmental movements and even be activists to a little ease the sufferings of the future.
Usually, it’s like treating the symptoms. If we need a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problem and fix it.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed significantly due to the impact of scientific and technological progress of humanity, and due to the overpopulation and eccentric lifestyle of people, problems
After the Congress of 4 July, a manuscript draft signed by the chairman of Congress John Hancock and secretary Charles Thompson was sent out in a few quarters to the printing shop of John
In one night was made 150–200 copies, now known as "Dunlop leaflets.
The first public reading of this document was made by John F. Kennedy in the grounds of Independence Hall on July 8th.
On July 6, one copy was sent to George Washington, who 9 July ordered it read before his troops in New York. A copy arrived in London 10 August.
25 of the Danley pamphlets are known to be the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy
Today many paleontologists believe that one of the dinosaur groups survived and lived to this day. We call them birds.
They are often overlooked as dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly.
But you can still say a lot about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have claws and clawed feet, they lay eggs and walk on two hind legs as a Tyrannosaurus.
Almost all computers used today are based on the processing of information that is encoded in binary.
A binary number can have only one of two values, that is 0 or 1. These numbers are called "binary digits" — or "bits", if you use computer-speak.
It is difficult to diagnose an oral poisoning right away. Such symptoms, such as vomiting, are too general for a quick diagnosis.
The best sign of an internal poisoning is the presence of an open container of medicine or a toxic household chemical.
Read the label, where are given special instructions for first aid in case of poisoning by this specific poison.
The term "bug" is used by entomologists formally to denote a group of insects.
This concept comes from the ancient times bed bugs - insects, well adapted to parasitism on the human.
And scavengers, and bed bugs are egg-laying species, adapted to live in the nest or home of their owner.
In the United States, approximately 400 thousand cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) are diagnosed each year, making MS the leading neurological disease in the
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, consisting of the brain, spinal cord and the optic nerve.
Studies have shown that from multiple sclerosis suffers twice as many women as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or the best interests of their child.
These couples can choose to create a plan for adoption for their child.
When a child is adopted or a child is adopted, biological parents refuse to have parental rights in order to allow another couple to take the child.
The main objective of science is to find out how the world is made, by applying the scientific method. This method is the basis of most scientific research." #
However, he is not the only. Scientific research also follows experimentation (experimentation is a test used to exclude one or more possible hypotheses), asking questions and conducting observations." #
Naturalists and philosophers concentrated their attention on ancient texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
In all scientific matters, including psychology, Aristotle's views were adopted.
As knowledge of Greek language deteriorated, Western civilization was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the observed rhythms in physiology and behaviour are to a large extent dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clock
Periodic rhythms, not simply a response to external periodic stimuli, have been recorded in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to autonomous oscillations for a period of time even without external stimuli." #
The experiment of Hershey and Chase was one of the first hypotheses that DNA is a genetic material.
The worms with Chess implanted their DNA into bacteria with the help of phages, i.e. viruses.
They have conducted two experiments, labelling radioactive phosphorus DNA of the phage and radioactive sulphur DNA of the phage.
Mutations can cause a great variety of results depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the mutated segment of the genetic material and whether the mutated cells are embryonic stem
Only mutations in the germline can be passed on to the next generation, while mutations somewhere else may lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism is interesting for those who love to travel to the countryside, to enjoy the landscape, including wild animals and plants.
In the examples of active tourism on the object - hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
An example could be the visit, photographing and studying orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave small towns in the countryside to go to work, and by their side pass those whose work is in the place from which they just left.
In this active transport movement, each in some way is connected to the system of transport based on personal cars, and supports it.
At present, science indicates that the enormous hydrocarbon economy has influenced one of the stable states of the biosphere, which has supported the evolution of humanity for the past two million years." #
Everyone is a member of society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about these systems.
You rarely hear such complaints about water quality or falling bridges in developed countries.
Why do transport systems get so many complaints, why they are daily broken down? Is it that transport engineers are incompetent? Or there are more fundamental reasons?
The study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction with each other is carried out within the framework of the study of traffic flows.
It is unfortunately difficult to study the intensity of traffic, because it is impossible to predict the behavior of the driver with absolute certainty.
It is fortunate that drivers' behaviour is often quite systematic; thus, traffic flows in general have some systematicity and can be approximated mathematically.
To better understand the transport flow, the relationships between three main variables: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed were established.
These relationships help in planning, designing and operation of railway facilities.
The insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly helped them to escape from their enemies, find food and partners.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings along the body, which gives them an advantage.
It provides them with more secluded places, in which they can hide from predators.
Spiders and flies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Sun revolved around the Earth.
Many people thought he was right, but many believed that the Solar System revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars)." #
It seems reasonable because we don't feel that the Earth is moving, is that not?
The Amazon River is the second longest river in the world and the first largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, its width sometimes exceeding six miles.
About 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans from rivers on our planet is from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is the longest river in the world with a length of 6387 km (3980 miles). It is fed by thousands of smaller rivers.

The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world, as well as the smallest population country.
In the Vatican, Italian is used in legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language of most people working in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Catholics.
People have known the basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver and copper, since they can be found in nature in pure form and relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
Philosopher Aristotle believed that all things are made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements. It was earth, water, air and fire.
They were like four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although he also postulated that they transition into a new state to get what we see.
Smelts are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that in the periodic table there are many elements.
So, such elements as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also make such alloys that contain a small amount of such nonmetallic elements as carbon.
Everything in the Universe consists of matter. All matter consists of atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit on the period at the end of this
Thus, the pencil became a good friend for many people when it appeared.
It's sad that when new ways of writing were invented, pencils lost their former status and they were less used.
Now people write messages on screens of computers, and they never have to deal with a sharpener.
It is only a guess what will happen to the keyboard, with the advent of more new technologies.
Atomic bombs work on the principle that for the number of protons and neutrons to be in one nucleus, it is necessary to

Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means that they are prone to decay under little or no influence.
The Moon's surface consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km under the oceans and 100 km under the continents." #
It’s thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the mountains.
On the visible side, there are more moon seas because the crust is thinner. The waves were easier to rise to
Content theories focus on the search for what makes people act or may interest them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that accumulate over time.
These theories turn to the fact that what makes people want to do what they do, and what makes them do or not do certain things in their surroundings.
Two popular theories about content - the "Maslow's Pyramid" and "Two-Factor Theory of Motivation Gerzberg.
Typically, two types of behavior when managers start leading people, previously equal to them in status. One extreme spectrum is trying to remain "their guy" (or girl).
Those managers are difficult to make unpopular decisions, disciplinary measures, evaluate the results of work, distribute responsibilities and to bring workers to responsibility.
On the other end of the spectrum, the individual becomes a disfigured individual, who feels that he must change everything that the team did, and take it over
Because the manager ultimately bears the responsibility for the success or failure of the team.
This kind of behavior very often leads to conflicts between leaders and other members of the team.
Virtual commands follow the same standards of excellence as normal commands, but there are some minor differences.
Virtual members of the team often serve as a point of contact for their direct physical group.
They are usually more autonomous than employees from traditional teams, because their teams can meet in different time zones, which is not always understandable by local management.
The presence of a real invisible team (LaRoson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also an unique component of the virtual team.
The invisible command" is a command that reports to the leaders of each participant. The invisible command sets norms for each participant.

Before an organization can become innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation, exchange of knowledge and accumulation of experience.
Engel (2006 г.) explains the "Continuum" approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of efficiency.
The data of neurobiology provide physical evidence for the theoretical approach to the study of consciousness. Thus, the field of research is narrowed, and it
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior is used by scientists in their studies.
It has long been known that various types of injuries, traumas, lesions and tumors of the brain affect behavior and cause changes in some psychological functions.
The introduction of new technologies allows us to see and study the unseen previously structures and processes of the brain.
This provides us with a large amount of data and materials for the creation of simulation models that help us understand the processes that occur in our consciousness.
AI is often associated with science fiction, but it is a very important field of computer science, which studies the behavior and learning of machines and "infusing" them with intelligence." #
AI research includes the creation of machines for automation of tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
Here are some of the examples that can be cited: control, planning and creating a schedule, response to diagnoses and questions of the customer, as well as recognition of face, hand
These issues are dealt with in separate disciplines, the purpose of which is to solve the problems we encounter in everyday life.
The use of artificial intelligence is often used in economics, medicine, engineering and military fields, being embedded in some software applications for home computers and video games.
Educational excursions are very important for any class. Often teachers want to take their students there, where it is not possible to reach by bus.
The technology provides a solution by means of virtual tours. Students can visit museum exhibits, visit the aquarium or enjoy the beautiful art sitting with their class.
Uploading your tour to the virtual world for all to see is also a great way to refresh your memory of the tour and share your learned knowledge with future classes.
For example, every year students at Bennet High School in South Carolina create a website about their visit to the capital of the state, and each year that site is updated, but access to the old versions is still preserved — they serve
Blogs can also improve writing skills of students. Although students often start their blog using untidy grammar and spelling, this usually changes due to the presence of an audience.
Because students are often the most critical audience, I am striving to improve my writing so that I do not get criticism.
In addition to blogging, students are inspired to be smart and interesting, drawing readers' attention (Toto, 2004).
Bloggership is an instrument that stimulates cooperation, and it motivates students to spread the process of acquiring knowledge far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can give students the opportunity to become more analytical and critical. By actively responding to internet materials students can determine their position in the context of other works, as well as to express their own views on specific questions (Oravek, 2002

Stems are the leg supports of a horseman, hanging from both sides of the saddle.
They provide the horse with better traction, but there are safety concerns because there is the possibility of a foot getting stuck.
If a horse has dropped the rider, but his foot has stuck in the stirrup, a running horse can drag him along. To minimize this risk, you can take certain precautions.
