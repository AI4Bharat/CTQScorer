Even if a promising experimental vaccine appears to reduce the mortality rate of Ebola, there is no cure yet that has been effective enough to treat the existing infection.
However, even though the administration of a cocktail of antibodies, ZMapp, had initially shown promising results on the field, formal studies have shown that its ability to limit deaths did not meet expectations.
In the PALM trial, the ZMapp served as a control, which meant that the scientists used it as a reference and compared it to the three other treatments.
The American Gymnastics Federation supports the letter of the United States Olympic Committee and accepts the absolute necessity of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the statement of the USOC (United States Olympic Committee) that our athletes and clubs, as well as their sport, could be better served by going forward and making substantive changes within our organization, rather than revoking accreditation.

It confirms not only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already very widely accepted, but provides further details that the fossils cannot usually provide, such as colour and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this bird's plumage was brown on top and pale or carotened on the bottom.
This discovery also helps us to understand the evolution of feathers in birds.
But the feathers of dinosaurs do not have a fully developed tail, but show other characteristics that are typical of feathers – beards and barbules – so the researchers concluded that the tail was probably an evolutionary development later on.
The feather structure suggests that they were not used in flight but rather for temperature regulation or display.
The scientists say this is certainly the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, but the sample reveals a feather belonging to an adult, not a juvenile.
A car bomb exploded at the headquarters of the police in Gaziantep, Turkey, this morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.

Uka's gun malfunctioned as she was aiming at the head of a fifth man. Schneider is in agony, can't see, has lost part of his skull, and his face has been rebuilt from titanium.
Schneider has testified by video link from an Air Force base in his country.
On Wednesday, Carpanedo participated in two individual races during the championships.
She then took part in the slalom, where she received a 'did not finish' (DNF) in her first race. 36 of the 116 competitors received the same result in this race.
His other event, the slalom, enabled him to finish tenth in the standings of the sitting women with a combined time of 4:41.30, that is 2:11 minutes less than the Austrian Claudia Loesch, who was first, and 1:09 minutes less than the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani, who was ninth.
In the category of women sitting down skiing, four skiers have not reached the finish line; in the slalom, 45 skiers out of 117 in this race have not been able to finish.
The police of Madhya Pradesh found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
The deputy inspector general D. K. Arya said: "We have arrested five people for violating the Swiss citizen, and we have recovered her mobile phone and laptop.
The accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the police commissioner, said that the accused had their faces covered when they appeared in court.
While three people were present in the house when the car hit it, no one was injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured to the head.
The road where the accident took place was temporarily closed to allow rescue teams to extract the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
It was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son by the Sheriff Court of Edinburgh.
She is in custody awaiting trial and awaiting her arrest, but eyewitness testimony could be compromised because her portrait has been widely disseminated.
It is a common practice in the United Kingdom, but the Scottish courts operate differently and have considered that publishing photographs was potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, from the University of Dundee, notes that "journalists seem to be following a dangerous line if they publish photographs, etc. of suspects.
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is responsible for the entire prosecution, has said to reporters that no other comment will be made at least until the prosecution.
According to the leak, the document will deal with the dispute at the border that the Palestinians claim on the basis of the existing borders before the Middle East War of 1967.
In addition to the other matters discussed, there is the future State of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of ten years from the signing of an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority only consents to a period of five years.
The shooters of the trial supplementary control of parasites were closely monitored by rangers, because the trial was closely controlled and its effectiveness assessed.
In the context of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) inc., qualified volunteers have been recruited, in the context of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, temporary conservation manager for the NPWS, the four hunters chosen for the first killing campaign have been properly trained and instructed in safety procedures.
Martelly has appointed a provisional Electoral Council (CEP) made up of nine members. 
It is the fifth PEC of Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the dissolution of the previous CEP in the context of a package of measures intended to engage the country on a new electoral path.
This commission was the response of Martelly to the widespread protests against his regime that started in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the absence of elections, which were scheduled to take place in 2011.
About 60 iPods overheated, causing six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been informed of 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy and Finance announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which it described as ‘not serious’.
The Ministry of Finance has responded by saying'really regrettable' that the report was postponed by Apple.
The earthquake struck the Mariannes at 7:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday)
The Emergency Management Office of the Northern Mariana Islands has declared that no damage has been reported in this country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre has said there is no sign of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer abducted tourists from Hong Kong in diverting their bus to Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot with his M16 at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and six of them have been confirmed to have died so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released prematurely, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the loo. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and became a doctor.
He went on to a medical training course and started working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When he was working at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature births while on his spare time. 
His research has shown that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the lung maturation of the baby.
Xinhua reported that the government's investigators recovered two flight recorders (black boxes) on Wednesday.
Other fighters also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: 'Luna was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. A unique moment, just like her. A strong woman.'
Dustin ‘ Goldust’ Runnels commented that ‘ Luna was as strange as me... or even more... I love her and she will be missed... I hope she rests in a better place.’
A survey conducted among 1,400 people before the federal elections in 2010 revealed that the number of opponents to the transformation of Australia into a republic had increased by 8 % since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the federal election campaign that she thought Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of those questioned share this view, and wish that Queen Elizabeth II is the last monarch to rule Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 % of those questioned think Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 % think Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was required to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical condition was questioned.
He could not take the necessary medication to overcome his pain, which was banned within the Games.
 Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest known prime number to date.
Many people have checked the discovery using different equipment and software at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Cosmic comets may have been a source of water for the earth, as well as organic matter that can form proteins and promote life.
The scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, and in particular how the Earth was formed, because comets have collided with it for a long time.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor in January and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumours of 'babble and nonsense'.
We think he will be running for the presidency in 2016.
According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that would allow aircraft to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, reducing carbon emissions.
It is based on satellite technology, and not on ground-based radar systems used previously, which allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more detailed information.
The additional transport is non-existent and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking and relay stations are not available on the ground.
The fear of not having enough transport has led to the possibility that the match could be played behind closed doors, without the fans of the teams.
A study published on Thursday in the Science journal has revealed the genesis of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and from Uppsala University in Sweden have indicated that the new species had evolved in only two generations, although this process has been estimated to have taken much longer, due to the reproductive interbreeding between a Darwin's finch endemic, Geospiza fortis, and the finch immigrant, Geospiza conirostris.
You can shape gold in many ways. It can be rolled into small pieces.
It can be drawn in fine wire, which can be twisted and woven. It can be hammered or laminated into sheets.
It can be made very fine, and glued onto another metal. It can be so fine that it has sometimes been used to decorate hand-painted images in manuscripts called "enlumined manuscripts.
That is what we call a chemical product pH. You can make an indicator by using carrot juice.
The cucumber juice changes colour according to the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the chemical sample.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electron (because hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron)." #
Mix the dry powders together, then, with clean hands and moist, press them into a ball.
The humidity on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will produce a strange sensation and produce a sort of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets equipped with a flush in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage
Found remains of sewer systems in the houses of Minoan Cretan cities and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, in Persia and China. In Roman times, public toilets sometimes included men and women in the public baths where they could meet.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite receives the call in space and then returns it to Earth almost instantaneously.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts a part of our light and our vision.
To put a satellite or a telescope into space, you need a giant rocket of around 30 metres high.
The wheel has changed the world in many ways. The greatest advantage it has given us is that it has made transport much simpler and faster.
This has brought us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
In the lower section are medium-sized carnivores that eat medium-sized prey, including rabbits, hares and deer.
In addition, there are many small cats (including those kept as pets in the wild) that eat small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a special task for each feline, preventing it from competing with the others.
The lions are the most sociable cats, living in large groups called herds.
The packs are composed of one to three adult males, as well as a number of females and cubs.
Women are generally very close to each other, their families being composed of a large number of sisters and daughters.
The lions act like packs of wolves or dogs, animals which are very similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in their behaviour, and also very deadly for their prey.
Balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (but sometimes difficultly), swim, jump large distances and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is part of the same family (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones capable of roaring.
The roar of the tiger does not sound like the roar of the lion, but rather a phrase whose words would be cries and groans.
The ocelot is a voracious carnivore. It catches monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if it can. Almost all the animals it hunts are much smaller than him.
According to scientists, ocelots hunt and find prey (prey) by smell, by sniffing the track on the ground.
They see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision, and they move also very stealthily. The ocelots hunt their prey by blending into their environment before leaping on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it is derived (for example, if it moves over a mountain range or river, or if it moves to a new island so that it cannot easily return to its former location), it often finds itself in a different environment than it was previously.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so that the new population will need new characteristics or adaptations to be a powerful competitor compared to what it had previously.
The original population has not changed at all, it still needs the same adaptations.
As time goes by, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look increasingly like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they will no longer be considered to belong to the same species.
We call this process ‘speciation’, which simply means the formation of new species. The speciation is an inevitable and very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, exhale).
Plants produce their food by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses and clothes from plants. Most of the foods we eat are plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The great white shark was the superpredator of the time, he didn't fear anything, except other great white sharks.
His long jaws were equipped with more than 70 sharp teeth, as well as a series of additional teeth in the palate, so that anything that crossed his path could not escape.
We don't know for sure, but it may have been a tongue-twister. His diet included turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been cannibal.
He also attacked everything that entered the water, even a dinosaur like a T. rex was not big enough against him.
While the Romans ate what we know today, they ate strange or unusual dishes, including deer, pigeons, snails and cockroaches, as well as the hare, a sort of rodent.
Another difference: while the poor and the woman ate their food sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to organise banquets where they rested on the side while they ate.
Roman meals of antiquity could not include these foods from America or Asia which were introduced in Europe centuries later.
For example, they did not have maize, tomatoes, potatoes, or cacao, and no ancient Romans ever tasted beef.
Babylonians built temples for each of their gods, which were regarded as the dwellings of the god.
People sacrificed to the gods and priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had a courtyard, then a sanctuary inside which only priests could enter.
Some pyramidal temples, the ziggurats, were sometimes built as part of a temple.
The summit of the tower was a special place for the god.
In the hot Middle East climate, the house was not so important.
The bulk of the Jewish family life was outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were only open counters, giving on the street. Houses were built of stone. 
As there were no large forests in Canaan, the wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In Scandinavian sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder that he found Greenland - and named it - in his travels further west.
But apart from its discovery, the Eskimo people lived there already at that time.
While each country is 'Nordic', there are many differences between the people, the kings, the customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the film Benjamin Gates and the Templar Treasure, you may think that a treasure map has been drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence. 
But, however, this is not true. There is a stamp on the back of the document, but it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, you could read the words 'Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776'. The text is on the reverse side of the document.
While no one is entirely sure who wrote it, it is known that at an early stage of its existence, the great scroll (which measures approximately 29 inches three-quarters on 24 inches) was rolled up. 
It is therefore likely that the rating was added simply as an indication.
The landing day and the subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
She was governed by French Vichy-era collaborators, who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupying power instead of facing it.
On 15 August 1940, Allied troops landed in southern France, an invasion called Operation "Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French Forces had liberated the south of France and were heading for Germany.
A civilisation is a unique culture shared by a significant number of people who live and work in cooperation, a society.
The word 'civilisation' derives from the Latin word 'civis', which means civil and which is related to the Latin words 'civis', which means citizen, and 'civitas', which means city or state and which indicates also, in some way, the size of the society to which it relates.
The city-states are the pioneers of nations. A civilisational culture involves the transmission of knowledge on several generations, a durable cultural empreinte and an equitable distribution.
Minority cultures are often lost without leaving any historically relevant traces and are not recognised as genuine civilisations.
In the Revolution, the thirteen States first formed a weak central government under Articles of the Confederation.
The Congress did not have the power to impose taxes, and as there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on the authorities of the state, often less cooperative, to enforce its acts.
He did not have the power to derogate from tax laws or from customs duties between Member States.
The articles required unanimous consent of all the Member States before they could be amended and the Member States took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, with Germany's national team, the second most successful team in the world and they won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
In popular sports, football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, equestrian sports, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 are included.
Skiing is the most popular sport in the North, Italians participating in international competitions and Olympic games.
Japan has 7 000 islands (the biggest being Honshu), which makes it the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the islands that make up it, Japan is often referred to as an 'archipelago'.
The first information about Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, while European navigators passing through it made mention of it as Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the south west of Taiwan, introducing a transformation of traditional agricultural practices in the island and employing Chinese workers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
On 16th June 1683, the Qing (1644-1912) forces take control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declare it a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after his defeat in the first Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Treaty, by which it ceded Taiwan to Japan, which was then in control of the island until 1945.
The Inca citadel is made up of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the sun temple and the three-window room.
Most of the buildings surrounding the complex have been rebuilt to provide better views of their original appearance.
In 1976, 30 percent of the Machu Picchu had been restored and this restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format of photographic film is 35 mm; it was the most common format of film used in the late analogue era.
It is still made today, but what is important is that its image format is inherited from the format of the digital camera sensors.
35 mm is actually 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
So we say that the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest of integer ratios) is 3:2.
A large number of common formats (APS family, for example) are equal to this aspect ratio or are close to it.
The third-party rule, which is often ridiculed and misused, is a simple directive that stimulates dynamism while offering a high level of protection.
He points out that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the vertical and horizontal lines dividing the image.
In this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, was questioned.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has bound the European states together despite the differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power touched everyone, from the King to the peasants.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to relieve suffering and poverty, and that the monetary resources of the church are there specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church was in Rome for over 1000 years and this concentration of power and money has led many people to ask whether this doctrine was respected.
After hostilities began, Britain put in place a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategy has proved effective, cutting vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade has been flagrantly violating international law generally accepted and codified by several international treaties of the last two centuries.
The UK mines international waters to prevent ships from venturing into entire areas of the sea, which represents a threat even to neutral ships.
As this tactic did not elicit a timid reaction, Germany expected a similar reaction in response to its submarine warfare without limits.
For many years, most citizens and nations showed a preference for pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, nations hoped to avoid such a situation happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four hundred dollars in his name, a poem and a recommendation letter from Charles Batchelor (his previous employer) to Thomas Edison.
China had a unique way of showing the different periods of China or each family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
Among each dynasty, there have also been periods of divided states. The most well-known of these periods is the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty.
In these periods, fierce battles took place between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms were one of the bloodiest periods in Chinese history. Thousands of people died in battle to sit on the throne of the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political repercussions such as the use of the metric system, the passing of absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people and not to one single leader.
As well, after the Revolution, the professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and the most talented to succeed.
As for the army, because the ranking of armies is no longer based on class, but on calibre.
The French Revolution also inspired many other working class people in other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions that transcended the worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that became famous under the name of 'Hira' on the mountain of 'Noor' (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which survived at that time, gives a very vivid picture of the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
Located at the top of one of the mountains in northern Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
 " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " 
Up there, you can only look at the clear sky and the many mountains surrounding it. From the inside of the cave, you can only see very little of this universe.
The Great Pyramid of Gizeh is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians during the third millennium BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many gigantic structures erected in honour of the Pharaohs who died.
The Giza Plateau, or 'Giza Necropolis', in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, contains several pyramids (the largest being the most imposing), several small tombs, many temples and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honour the Pharaoh Khéops, and many smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honour his wives and his family.
The symbol ‘push’ looks like a V and the symbol ‘pull’ looks like a staple or a square with a missing bottom.
The top signifies that you must begin by the tip and push the bow, and the bottom signifies that you must begin by the arrow rest and pull the bow.
A bow upwards produces a softer sound, while a bow downwards produces a louder sound.
Don't forget to write your own names in pencil, but don't forget that the musical stave marks are printed for a musical reason, and you should therefore generally respect them.
On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, eleven years old, and Louis-Charles, four years old), and the sister of the king, Madame Elisabeth, all terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of
In a carriage they went back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and screamed threats against the king and the queen.
The King and Queen were forced to open the windows of their carriages because of the crowd.
At a point in time, a crowd member brandished the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles before the terrified queen.
The American imperialist war expenditures in the Philippines have been paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large part of the expenses and interest of the bonds issued by the Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the superprofits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people could constitute the basic benefits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context in which they were created.
These events took place during the period generally considered to be the High Middle Ages – a period of European history from the eleventh to the thirteenth century (1000-1300).
The Middle Ages Central preceded the High Middle Ages and followed by the Low Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from the technological push or the imperative to a strict sense of the term, in which the destiny of humanity is dictated by a logical underpinning linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies.
Among the interpretations of technological determinism, there is agreement on two general ideas: technological development itself is a process that transcends cultural and political influences, and technology has an impact on societies that are intrinsically conditioned rather than socially.
For instance, one could say that the automobile is a necessary precondition for the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a few cars, so new methods of production are developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Massive ownership of cars also leads to an increased incidence of road traffic accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the field of healthcare for treating the body injuries.
Romanticism presented an important cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
According to Romantic theories, geography has shaped individuals and, over time, customs and a culture associated with this geography have emerged. These, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris is known as the capital of the fashion world of the contemporary world, Constantinople was regarded as the capital of the feudal Europe.
His reputation as the centre of luxury began around 400 BC and lasted until 1100 AD.
His status has declined over the twelfth century, mainly because the Crusaders returned with presents such as silk and spices, which the Byzantine markets could not compete with.
That is when the title of the capital of fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 9th and 11th centuries and then declined in the 13th century.
At first, the robe was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture, to the east.
However, due to the slowness of communication means, Western modes could accuse a 25-30 year lag.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time, following the crusades, was the use of buttons for closing clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is a form of agriculture practised to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic, system using locally conserved seeds combined with rotational farming or other simple techniques to maximise yield.
Historically, most farmers practised subsistence farming and that is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures are groups of individuals who feel neglected by the social norms and share the same ideas which enable them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnic origin, class, location and / or sex of members.
The criteria that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
Subculture members often signal their membership by distinctive and symbolic use of style, which encompasses modes, maniérismes and slang.
One of the most common ways of illustrating the importance of socialization is to draw on a few unfortunate cases of children who, by neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse, have not been socialized by adults during their childhood.
Those children are considered to be 'wild' or 'wild'. Some children were locked up by their own parents; in some cases, abandonment was due to the parents' rejection of a severe intellectual or physical disability that the child suffered.
Wild children may have suffered severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or escaping.
Others would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in the wild.
When they are raised entirely by non-human species, wild children display almost the same behavioural traits as those of the species that raised them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
As learning projects should make learning easier and more interesting, the support goes further.
Support is not a method of learning but rather a means of helping learners who discover a new teaching such as the use of a new programme or the start of a new project.
Supports can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but the little Microsoft Office trombone is also one.
Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are intended to guide, explain and interrogate procedures that would have been too difficult to manage for the student alone.
Children are placed in foster homes for very diverse reasons, from neglect to maltreatment, from extortion to bribery.
No child should ever have to grow up in a situation that is not stimulating, attentive and educational, but it is the case.
We perceive the family placement system as a safe zone for these children.
Our family placement system is supposed to provide safe, loving homes, stable education and reliable healthcare.
The placement in family homes is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were previously removed.
Internet combines mass communication elements and interpersonal communication elements.
The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approaches to usages and gratifications.
For example, 'learning' and'socialization' are seen as major factors promoting Internet use (James et al., 1995).
‘Personal involvement’ and ‘continuous relationships’ were also identified as being new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied the public reactions to the internet.
Video recording has led to great discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, that is, facial expressions during a few milliseconds.
They claim, for example, that one can detect if a person is lying by interpreting correctly micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, has indicated how people with brain damage are still able to assess the sincerity of the speech accurately.
He suggests that such capacities for human interpretation may be found in domestic dogs.
The research of the twentieth century has shown that there are two genetic reservoirs: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and the selection removes it from the gene pool of expressed variations.
The segregation and recombination alternate between the two basins at each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet its amino acid needs from the available plant resources.
In addition, a lack of response has serious consequences: growth disorders, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible resources would be the proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult to digest for us, unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest and provide a large amount of proteins containing all essential amino acids.
In my view, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors have solved their 'protein problem' in a similar way to chimpanzees in the savanna today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentional waking during your sleep and subsequently relaxing for a period of 10 to 60 minutes.
It can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock, so that you can wake up without waking up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock during your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on the biorhythm include drinking a lot of liquids before going to bed (especially water or tea, reputed to be diuretics), which forces you to wake up to go to the toilet.
The degree of peace within a person opposes to the degree of tension in his or her body and mind.
The less tension there is, the more the present life force is positive. Each person has the possibility of finding absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way is our own tension and our negativeness.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been enriched by the mahayana path and by many Indian yoga techniques.
In principle, the Tibetan Buddhist is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and universal love path.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (illumination) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The Tibetan meditation centre is the yoga of the deity. It is through visualisation of different deities that the channels of energy are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of awakening is created.
The Germans were a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the US. At the end of the war, deep conflicts between their different systems, methods and cultures ended the agreement between these two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and see real battles, through proxy armies, on battlefields in Africa and Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and in many other places.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defence was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganise along the Romanian front.
But these plans have become obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800 000 Soviet troops arrived and created the Bieloruss and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, as well as other international treaties, whether bilateral or multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient means of transporting large quantities of people and goods through the oceans.
The work of the armed forces has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and your goods, while interfering with your enemy's ability to move his people and his goods.
One of the most recent examples of this situation has been the campaign North Atlantic during the Second World War. The Americans tried to cross the Atlantic Ocean to help the British.
At the same time, the German Navy, using mainly U-Boats, tried to stop this trade.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as it has done for the rest of Europe.
It seems that the goats were domesticated for the first time about 10 000 years ago in the Zagros mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures began to keep them close to them so that they could easily access milk, fur, hair and skin.
Domestic cattle were usually kept in herds that wandered on hills or other pastures, often cared for by herders who were most often children or adolescents, similar to the more familiar term of shepherds.
The 'wagonways' were built in England in the 16th century.
While the rails were simply made of parallel planks of wood, they allowed horses to pull them faster and carry heavier loads than on roads that were slightly more accident-prone during the day.
The crossrails were introduced early to keep the tracks in place. However, it was soon realised that the tracks would be more effective if they were provided with a rail on top.
It has become a common practice, but the iron has caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails were introduced.
The first means of locomotion was walking: humans began to walk upright two million years ago with the arrival of the Homo Erectus ("right-handed man").
 Their predecessors, the australopithecines, did not walk upright as usual.
There are bipedal specializations in fossils of Australopithecus afarensis from 4,2 to 3,9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs already seven million years ago.
We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even campaign in the name of mitigating the sufferings to come.
In many cases, it is a symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not just want a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems and disable them.
It is clear that the world has changed a lot thanks to the advances in science and technology made by human beings, and that the problems have become more serious because of the overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
After it was adopted by the Congress on 4 July, a draft signed by the House Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to a few blocks away, to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
In the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, known as 'Dunlap Broadsides'.
The public reading of the document was held by John Nixon in the Independence Hall on July 8.
One of them was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who read it to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy reached London on 10 August.
The 25 sheets Dunlap that are still known to exist are the oldest known copies of the document. The original manuscript copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive. They are called birds.
Many people regard them as dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly.
But there are many birds that look like dinosaurs.
They have scales on their feet and claws, they lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like T-Rex.
In practice, all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information which are coded in binary form.
A binary number can only have one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary numbers, or bits for using the computer jargon.
An internal poisoning can not be seen immediately. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are sufficiently general to allow a diagnosis to be made immediately.
The best indicator of internal poisoning is probably the presence of a closed container of toxic household products.
See the label for the specific first aid instructions for this poison.
The term 'insect' is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term derives from an ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are very adapted to parasitizing humans.
Rabbits, like bed bugs, are nidicolous, that is, they are adapted to live in the nest or habitat of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400 000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which makes it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Sclerosis en plaques is a disease that affects the central nervous system, consisting of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have MS than men.
A couple may very well feel that it is not in their interest, nor in the child's interest, to look after the child's education.
These couples can choose to adopt their baby.
In the context of adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main objective of science is to understand how the world works through scientific method. This method guides in fact most scientific research.
However, it is not the only, experimentation, and an experiment is a test that serves to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, to ask questions and to observe, but it also orients the scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers have concentrated on ancient texts, and in particular on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's opinions on all scientific questions, including psychology, were accepted.
With the decline of Greek knowledge, Western civilization has been cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed physiological and behavioural rhythms are often dependent on the presence of endogenous rhythms and their production by endogenous clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which do not simply represent responses to periodic stimuli, have been documented for most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to operate for a certain period even without external stimulation.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the principal indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacteria.
They have carried out two experiments to mark either the DNA of the phage with a radioactive phosphorus, or the protein of the phage with a radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the extent of the mutated material, and whether the mutated cells are germ cells.
Only germ cell mutations can be passed on to children, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism is aimed at people who want to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, in particular wildlife and flora.
Hunting, fishing, bird watching, photographing, observing birds, visiting parks and studying the ecosystem are examples of activities on the spot.
You can go and see, photograph and discover the orang-utans of Borneo.
Every morning people leave the small towns in cars to get to their places of work and cross other people who are going to work in the country they have just left.
In this dynamic transport bus, everyone is in some way connected to a private car-based transport system and supports it.
The science now shows that this massively carbon-based economy has pushed the biosphere out of its stable state which has supported human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about water quality or bridge collapses.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they break down every day? Transportation engineers are simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movements of drivers and private vehicles between two points, and the interactions they exert between themselves.
It is difficult to study traffic flow because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred per cent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act in a reasonable range; so, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable consistency, and can be represented mathematically in a rough way.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) the flow, (2) the density and (3) the speed.
These relationships help to plan, design and operate road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly enabled them to escape more easily from their enemies and to find more effectively food and companions.
Insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body.
It gives them more hiding places for themselves.
Today, only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and the ephemerals.
There are some 4,000 years ago, a man called Aristotle said that the solar system moved around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but many thought he was wrong: that the solar system moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
It seems reasonable, because the Earth does not seem to be moving, is that not?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times the volume of water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the world's largest river, reaching up to 10 kilometres wide.
About 20 percent of the water that falls from rivers on the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River arm is over 6 387 km (3 980 miles). It collects the water from thousands of small rivers.
While the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Great Pyramid of Gizeh never surpassed its size and the technical excellence of its construction.
Ancien Egyptians of the New Empire were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, who had then been in existence for over a thousand years.
Vatican City has around 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and the least populated.
The Vatican is drafting its legislation and its official communications in Italian.
Italian is also the language of everyday use by most of the staff working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
The citizens of the Vatican City are all Catholics.
From antiquity, people have been familiar with basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, because they are found in nature as raw materials and are quite simple to mine using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, has theorised that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. It was earth, water, air and fire.
It was rather the four states of matter (in the same order) : solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although he also held the view that these would transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered as metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of minuscule particles called atoms.
The atoms are so small that billions of them could enter into the period at the end of this sentence.
So, a pencil was a good friend to many people when it was first released.
Despite this, the emergence of new modes of writing has marginalised the pen to a more private status and to less frequent uses.
People now write messages on screens, without ever having to get near a pencil.
It is hard to imagine what the keyboard will look like when the next new thing arrives.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it combines a nucleus of a myriad of protons and neutrons.
Like if you were to make a hill climb on a heavy cart. Dividing the core again, then releasing a little of this energy.
Some atoms have a volatile nucleus, so that they tend to break up with little or no pressure.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust. Its outer layer is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the visible side and 100 km on the hidden side.
It is thinner at the sea level and thicker under the continents.
There may be more Maria on the side near because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are focused on the search for what makes people feel good or attracted.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires which have been internalized as they matured into adulthood.
These theories look at what drives some people to want what they do and what drives them to do or not do certain things in their environment.
Popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviours can emerge when a manager becomes the boss of former colleagues. From the extreme end of the spectrum being to try to stay 'the good friend' (or 'the good friend').
This type of manager is not able to take unpopular decisions, carry out disciplinary actions, carry out risk assessments, delegate responsibilities, and hold others responsible.
On the other end of the spectrum, one becomes a person who is unrecognizable, feeling that he/she must change everything that the group has created up to now and do things his/her way.
After all, the boss is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
That behaviour often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical team.
They have often more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet at different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
A truly invisible "team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also an unique element of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the management team to which each member reports. It establishes the standards for each of them.
Why would an organisation want to impose the tedious process of creating a learning structure? One of the objectives of applying organisational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently in the functional services of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can be fully expressed.
Thus, a process of working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
Before an organisation is innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and its own learning culture.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used by organisations to achieve better results.
Neuroscientific data provide material evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research. This allows us to reduce the research field and make it much more precise.
Correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research.
We know for a long time that different types of damage, lesions, tumours and brain damage affect behaviour and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies has enabled us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and materials to build models of simulation which help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence is often strongly associated with science-fiction, it is a very important part of computer science that studies intelligent behaviour, learning and adaptation.
Artificial intelligence research is aimed at automating tasks requiring an intelligent approach.
In the examples are included control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnostics and customer questions, as well as recognition of writing, voice and face.
These practices led to distinct disciplines, focused on the provision of solutions to the everyday problems faced by people.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and military, as it was used in several home computer games and domestic software.
Excursions are integral to any school. Often, a teacher would like to take his pupils to places where a bus journey is not possible.
The solution is provided by virtual educational outputs. Students can watch ancient objects from a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a beautiful work of art while sitting in their class.
Participating practically to a trip is also a good way to think about a trip and to share your experiences with future generations.
For example, students from Bennett High School in North Carolina design each year a website dedicated to their visit to the state capital. Each year, the website is updated, but the old versions are kept online for use as an album.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Even if students often try blogging with poor grammar and spelling, having a public audience makes the situation more likely to improve.
As students are often the most critical of the blog's author, the blogger begins to work to improve his writing in order to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging "forces students to be more intelligent and interesting" (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are an effective tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning well beyond the traditional school day.
When blogs are used well, they can enable students to strengthen their analytical and critical thinking skills: by responding actively to online content, they can confront their own opinion to that of others and present their own views on specific topics.
Ottawa is the charming capital of Canada and has a large number of galleries of art and museums that highlight the past and present of Canada.
You will find more south the falls of Niagara and north, the Muskoka region and its environs which have a virgin natural beauty.
All these measures, and many more, make Ontario what foreigners regard as the quintessence of Canada.
A large part of the north is sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited at the wild state.
For a comparison that will surprise you: there are more African-Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The Eastern African islands are located in the Indian Ocean, close to the African coast.
Madagascar is by far the largest country, and even a continent by itself, in terms of wildlife.
Most of the small islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known for being luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought the practice of Islam to the land and this religion has spread widely to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route which links Europe to India.
North, the region is bounded by the Sahel, and to the south and east by the Atlantic Ocean.
To women: It is recommended that any woman who travels say that she is married, irrespective of her civil status.
It is also recommended to wear an alliance (which should not seem too precious.
Women must realise that some cultural differences can lead to behaviours that they regard as harassment. It is, indeed, common that they are followed, caught by the arm, etc.
Be firm in your refusal of advances from men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it does not mean it is acceptable!)
Modern Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 9th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and the Mernaides as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese, who after it had been destroyed had rebuilt it and named it Casa Branca, finally abandoned it in 1755 after a major earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city under the name of Daru l-Badya, and it was renamed Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in all of Morocco for shopping.
Around the old medina, it is easy to find places where you can buy traditional Moroccan products, such as tajines, pottery, leather goods, nargilehs and all sorts of bibelots, but it is all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located in the extreme east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city centre.
Although Goma is reasonably secure, all visits to the outside of Goma should be subject to investigation to understand the state of the fighting in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of the Nyiragongo volcano as well as for gorilla tracking treks among the least expensive in Africa.
You can use boda-bodas (motor taxis) to get around in Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 CFA for a short trip.
Combined with its relative remoteness, 'Tombouctou' has become a metaphor for remote and exotic countries.
Today, Tombouctou is a poor city, although its reputation as a tourist destination makes it a popular airport.
In 1990, it was added to the World Heritage List as a threatened site because of the desert sands threatening its existence.
It was one of the major steps in the programme " Wonders of the African World " broadcast by Henry Louis Gates on the PBS.
The city contrasts strongly with the rest of the country, because it has a style more Arab than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the border south is the Crocodile River." #
The total area of the park is 19 500 km2, divided into 14 ecozones, each housing a specific fauna.
It is one of the most famous South African National Parks and considered to be the jewel in the crown of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As for all South African national parks, there are daily entry and conservation fees.
It may be advantageous to obtain a Wild Card which gives access to certain South African national parks, as well as all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the namesake of the territory of Hong Kong and represents the main attraction for many tourists.
The row of buildings that forms the horizon of Hong Kong has been compared to a glittering bar chart, which is revealed by reflection in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To admire the most beautiful panoramas of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to Kowloon's seafront located opposite.
The vast majority of the urban development of Hong Kong is concentrated on the north-eastern side of the harbour.
This is the place that the British colonists have invested. Thus, I think that this is a good starting point if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this region.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest mangrove forest belt, extending for 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the hinterland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located on the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
Forests, however, are not only composed of mangrove swamps: they also contain some of the last vestiges of the majestic jungles that covered the Ganges plain in the past.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3 850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water/wetlands.
Sundarbans is a nature reserve since 1966, you will find about 400 Bengal tigers and about 30 000 spotted deer.
Buses leave the district bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, but most, especially those that serve the east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6 and 7 in the morning.
Inter-city buses are often full, so it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese ships, which are comfortable and robust.
Public buses are a fast and comfortable way to get to places near, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock Bridge is a suspension bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to link the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint George's in Guyana.
The two towers stand at a height of 83 metres; it is 378 metres long and has two 3,50 m wide lanes.
The vertical displacement under the bridge is 15 meters. The structure was completed in August 2011, but it was opened to traffic only in March 2017.
The bridge should be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs posts should be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group living in what is now the eastern part of Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also practising subsistence farming.
Other indigenous tribes who populated the Chaco, such as the Guaycurú or the Payaguá, survived mainly by fishing, hunting, or gathering.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, once called the 'giant province of India', was born out of the meeting of the Spanish conquistadors and the indigenous peoples.
The Spanish inaugurated the period of colonisation, which lasted for three centuries.
From the foundation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain a large part of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best teams and the best polo players in the world.
The biggest polo tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
In addition, smaller tournaments and matches are sometimes organised here at other times of the year.
For information on polo tournaments and where to buy tickets, see the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Isle of Man is the Manx Pound (FKP), which is equivalent to a pound sterling (GBP).
The money can be exchanged at the only bank in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
The pound sterling is a widely accepted currency in the islands, while at Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the nearby islands, credit cards may not be accepted, even if it is possible that the British and American currencies will be accepted. Talk to the owners in advance to agree on a payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange money from the Maldives outside the islands, so change it before you leave the islands.
Montevideo is located south of the Equator, so winter in the northern hemisphere corresponds to summer in the southern hemisphere.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical zone and summer temperatures exceeding 30°C are common.
The winter can be misleadingly cold: temperatures rarely fall below zero, but wind and humidity combine to give the impression that it is colder than what the thermometer says.
There are no 'rainy' and 'dry' seasons: the rainfall is pretty constant all year round.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, they are still wild animals; please do not feed them or disturb them.
According to the park authorities, you should be at least 100 metres away from wolves and bears and at least 25 metres away from all other wild animals!
As docile as they might appear, the bison, the elk, the moose, the wolf, and almost all the great animals can attack.
Every year, hundreds of visitors are injured because they did not keep a sufficient distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them some space.
In addition, know that the smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid transporting or cooking food that has an unpleasant smell, and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has about 40 000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and is the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a tragic naval standoff in 1889, when seven German, American and British ships refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, apart from a British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
The Supreme Head Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was murdered during a peaceful rally held in the city during the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement.
The beaches are numerous, because Auckland is at the mercy of two ports. The most popular ones are in three zones.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the district of North Harbour) lie on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay north to Devonport south.
Every beach is sandy and safe to swim in, and most are shaded by Pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the affluent suburb of Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in the centre of Auckland.
The beaches, often very popular with families, have many shops along the coast. The water is safe to swim in.
The local beer is the 'Number One', a rather ordinary beer, but tasty and refreshing. There is also another local beer, the 'Manta'.
There are many French wines to taste, but the New Zealand and Australian wines will travel better.
You can drink the local tap water without any danger, but you can easily find bottled water if you have any concerns about it.
For Australians, the idea of a 'coffee cream' is foreign. A short black is an 'espresso', a cappuccino is filled with cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is Belgian standard. Fruit juices are expensive but good.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries caused by one of these causes on the reef are rare.
However, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signs and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
From October to April, the box jellyfish arrive at the beaches and estuaries of rivers. They can also sometimes be seen outside of this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most of them are afraid of humans and would run away.
Salmon crocodiles do not live in the ocean, their main habitat is estuarine rivers in the north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveller the peace of mind that he will have somewhere to sleep once he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, but you can also book accommodation through travel agents of other types of accommodation, such as camping sites.
Travel agencies usually offer packages including breakfast, airport transfers or even packages combining flights and accommodation.
They can also hold your booking if you need time to think about the offer or to procure other documents necessary for your destination (for example, a visa).
Any change or request must, however, be addressed to the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants decide to camp there, and most consider that it is an integral part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the musical event, you will have to arrive early to find a good camping site.
Don't forget that even if the main music events are over, other music events can continue until late at night on other sites of the festival.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are travelling through the Baltic Sea in winter, be sure to check the location of the hut, because the ice can cause unbearable noises at the most exposed huts.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include time spent in the city. Passengers on cruises are exempt from the visa requirement (see the conditions).
Casinos generally make a lot of efforts to maximise the time and money spent by customers. There are rarely windows and clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They generally offer special offers of food, drinks and entertainment to keep the guests happy and to keep them there.
On some sites, it is the premises that offer free alcoholic beverages. However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good players should know that it is crucial to remain sober.
Anyone who travels to high latitudes or crosses mountains must consider the possibility of snow, ice or cold temperatures.
On icy roads and snowy conditions, the friction is low and you cannot drive like you are on the asphalt.
In the blizzards, it can fall in a very short space of time enough snow to block you.
The visibility can also be limited by snow or ice or by condensation or frost on the windows of vehicles.
In addition, the presence of ice and snow is normal in many countries, and the traffic is practically continuous all year round.
Safaris are probably the most popular tourist attraction in Africa and the most memorable moment for many visitors.
Safari" is a colloquial term for an African excursion, and especially for a safari in the African savanna, which aims to witness the amazing spectacle of wild animals in their natural habitat.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach close to cars and standard equipment allows them to be observed well.
Lion, leopard and lions are sometimes timid and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as 'walking safari', 'footing safari' or 'walking safari') consists of walking, either for a few hours, or for several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will take place in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, after hosting the Games in 1964.
If you have booked your flights and accommodation in 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you are likely to be in a difficult position.
The policies of cancellation vary, but from March onwards, most cancellation policies based on the coronavirus do not extend to July 2020, the date on which the Olympics had been planned.
We expect most events tickets to cost between EUR 2 500 and EUR 130 000, the typical tickets costing around EUR 7 000.
Wet clothes can be dried more easily if you pass them over a drying rack. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards that can be borrowed, even if there is no iron in the room. 
If you don't have a iron or if you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if you find one.
Avoid overheating the fabric (which can cause shrinkage or in extreme cases, burn it).
There are different methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it is enough to boil water for a minute; in others, it is necessary to boil it for several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you have a problem, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter pest animals they do not know in their home region.
Parasites may contaminate food, provoke irritations or, in the most serious cases, provoke allergic reactions, spread venom or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals which can wound or kill people by force, are not usually considered to be parasites.
In certain localities, tax-free shops present an opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and customs duties.
Travellers to countries where taxes are high can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on alcoholic drinks and tobacco.
The most difficult section of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway is the section between Point Marion and Fairmont, which passes through isolated backcountry areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep an open mind: steep gradients, narrow roads and tight curves predominate.
The speed limits displayed are considerably lower than those displayed in previous stages – usually from 35 to 40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and stricter enforcement is still more important than before.
On the other hand, the mobile service is surprisingly much stronger here than on many other parts of the road, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cakes are generally good, and in Bavaria, they are very rich and varied, very similar to those of their southern neighbour, Austria.
Fruit cakes are a common feature of the season: apples are baked and cooked in cakes all year round, while pears and plums are in season in summer.
Many German bakery products contain hazelnuts, almonds and other nuts. Popular German cakes often go well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want small but tasty Berliners, try the Berliners, also called Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region.
A curry is a dish made from herbs and spices, accompanied by meat or vegetables.
A curry dish can be'solid' or 'liquid', depending on the amount of sauce it contains. 
Yogurt is commonly used in curries in the interior regions of India and Pakistan, while in the south of India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesia having 17 000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines present in all of the country.
However, when this term is used without any other qualifying term, it tends to refer to foods from the central and eastern island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a wide range of simple dishes, the predominant flavours being the cashews, peppers, sugar (especially coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are the supports for the feet of the rider, which hang from each side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability to the user, but they can pose a safety problem: in fact, the user's feet can get stuck there.
If a rider is thrown from a horse, but has a leg caught in the stirrup, he could be dragged if the horse escapes. To minimise this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
First, most horses wear riding boots with a flat sole and a narrow heel.
In addition, some saddles, such as English saddles, have safety bars which allow a rider to fall off the saddle if it is pulled back by a rider who falls.
Valle de Cochamó – The excellence destination for rock climbing in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with many different granite faces and cliffs.
From the top of the mountains, the panoramas are spectacular. The alpinists of the whole world are discovering new routes on the slopes, where the possibilities are limitless. 
Skiing downhill, in particular skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports which consist in sliding down a snowy slope with skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity that has many fans, sometimes called'ski bums', who organise their entire holidays around skiing in specific places.
The idea of skiing is very ancient: paintings of caves showing skiers date for some of 5 000 years ago!
Skiing as a sport has been practised for at least a century; the first ski club in Australia was founded in 1861 by Norwegians.
Skiing: this activity is also referred to as Nordic skiing, cross-country skiing or skiing in the mountains.
It resembles alpine skiing, as well as alpinism, but does not include these activities, which are practiced on rocky terrains and require the use of skis and boots much stiffer than those used in alpine skiing.
Think of the skiing route as a similar hiking route.
In good conditions you can walk a little further than you can run – but you will never reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy pack on a muddy track.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it contains many independent countries. In normal circumstances, travelling through several countries involves several visa applications and several passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, works a little like one country in this regard.
As long as you remain within this area, you can usually cross the borders without having to go through passport control points.
On the other hand, having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply separately for each of the Member States of the area, which allows you to save time, money and administrative procedures.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique. Some tax authorities define items over 100 years old as antiquities.
The criteria vary according to where one is located; in some parts of the world, as in North America, the age limit may be lower than that in force in Europe.
Artisanal products can be regarded as antiquities even if they are less ancient than similar industrial products.
Ranging reindeer is a major means of subsistence for Samis and the culture surrounding this trade is of great importance to many other professions.
Although, according to tradition, all Samis have not been involved in large-scale reindeer herding, they lived mainly from fishing, hunting and other similar activities, and used reindeer mainly as livestock.
Today, many Samis practice modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Lapland, the Sami region.
While widely used, especially among non-Romas, the term 'Gypsy' is often considered to be pejorative because of its association with negative stereotypes and an unfair image of the Roma people.
If the country you are visiting is subject to a travel warning issued by your government, your overseas health insurance or travel insurance may be affected.
You can also consult other governments, but their advice is tailored to their citizens.
As an example, the citizens of the United States in the Middle East might be confronted to different situations than those of Europeans or Arabs.
The opinions are only a brief summary of the political situation of a country.
The opinions presented are often superficial, general and too simplified in comparison to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Violent weather is the generic term for any dangerous meteorological phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of life.
The weather conditions can be very unfavourable anywhere in the world, and they can be of several kinds, depending on the geographical, topographical and meteorological features.
Violent winds, hail, excessive precipitation and fires are forms and effects of violent weather, just as tornadoes, hurricanes, cyclones and tropical storms are.
Extreme weather events, such as cold, snowy and sandy storms, and sandstorms are also included.
It is strongly recommended that travellers check the weather forecast for their destination region, knowing that it may have an impact on their travel routes.
Anyone considering going to a country which could be seen as a war zone should receive vocational training.
A search on the Internet for "Cours in hostile environment" will probably provide the address of a local business.
A course will cover the issues raised here in much more detail, usually with a practical experience.
A training course normally lasts for 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, lots of first aid, and sometimes a training in the use of weapons.
Books and magazines on survival in the wild are common, but the publications on war zones are scarce.
Travellers planning to undergo a gender reassignment abroad should be sure to have valid travel documents for their return journey.
The governments' desire to issue passports with no sex indicated (X) or to update documents to correspond to the desired name and sex varies.
The will of foreign governments to honour these documents is variable.
The security checks at checkpoints have also become much more intrusive in the wake of 11 September 2001.
Transsexual people in the pre-op phase should not be expected to pass the scans in order to preserve their privacy and dignity.
Resistance currents are the currents that return from breaking waves, often on a reef or equivalent.
Because of the underwater topography, the return flow is concentrated on a few deeper sections, and a fast current can form in the deep waters.
In most cases, deaths are due to exhaustion resulting from attempting to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
When you leave the current, swimming back is not more difficult than usual.
You may try to aim at a place where you will not be caught again. It is also possible that, depending on your skills and whether you have been spotted or not, you may want to wait for help.
The shock of reintegration occurs earlier than the cultural shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer and is more serious.
Travellers who have had difficulty adjusting to the new culture have sometimes a great deal of difficulty adjusting to their home culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and have lost some of your own culture's habits.
At the beginning, when you went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travellers in a new country must adapt.
People may not be prepared to accept that patience and understanding are also necessary for passengers and passengers returning home.
The light and sound show at the Pyramid is one of the most interesting attractions in the region for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
Often, we hear the sound of tourists and hawkers. The history of sound and light is like a history book.
The Sphinx is the backdrop and the narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and the different pyramids are lit.
The Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the largest number of stations in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. The King George Island, with the village of Villa Las Estrellas, is the largest.
Other examples: Livingston Island and the Deception, where the inland caldera of an active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbour.
Ellsworth Land is the southern part of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula are melting into the plateau, then reappearing to form the Ellsworth Mountains, a 360 km long chain of mountains and traversed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, contains the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which stands at 4892 m.
In remote areas, without cellular network, you may have no other choice but to use satellite telephony.
A satellite telephone does not replace a mobile telephone, because you need to be outside and have a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
It is a common service used by navigation, including boats, as well as by expeditions that require data transmission at a distance and telephone calls.
Your local telephone operator should be able to tell you more about the connection to this service.
Those who are planning a year off have the opportunity to learn by travelling, and more and more of them are choosing this option.
This formula is particularly popular with young people who leave school, because it allows them to take a year off before university, without compromising their studies.
Often, having taken a year off to study abroad can actually give you better chances of getting into higher education in your home country.
Generally, you have to pay tuition fees for these educational programmes.
Finland is a popular destination for sailing. The "Land of the thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, in lakes and archipelagos on the coast.
You do not necessarily need a yacht in the archipelagoes and on the lakes.
While the archipelagoes and the largest lakes are certainly big enough for a yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Sailing is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden and New Zealand are in the same situation, but apart from that, it is a unique case (in the Netherlands, for example, the number is one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises are characterized by a prolonged stay in St. Petersburg, in Russia.
That means you can visit the historic city for several days,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you do not get off the boat with cruise excursions, you will not need a separate visa (from 2009).
The city of Berlin, in Germany, is mentioned in some brochures for cruises. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not at all located near the sea and no visit to this city is included in the cruise price. 
Flying can be a terrifying experience for all ages and from all walks of life, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It is not shameful: it is not different from the fears and fears that many people have about other things.
To some, understanding something about the operation of aircraft and what is going on during a flight can help to overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or on the fact that you do not have control.
Transport companies are well paid to deliver goods quickly. Often, in an urgent repair, the question of time is crucial for documents, goods or spare parts that relate to them.
On some roads, large companies have their own aircraft, but on other roads and for small firms, there has been a problem.
If they had shipped goods by air, on some routes, it would have taken days to clear customs and to unload the cargo.
The only way to get it to the airport faster was to send it as registered baggage. The airline regulations will not allow them to send a bag without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The easiest way to travel first class or business class is to pay a big sum of money for this privilege (or, better still, ask your company to do it for you).
But that is not cheap at all: in general, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare, and eleven times for first class!
Generally, it is not necessary to seek to obtain discounts for Business Class or First Class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that they can count on certain types of passengers who are willing to pay very high prices for the privileges of speed and comfort, and they set their prices in good faith.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is very common.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic which is suffering from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict resulted in the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, with its own government and currency, but recognised by no member of the United Nations.
The economic links have been restored between these two parts of the Republic of Moldova despite the failure of the political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
With a population of 3.7 million, İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey, the second port after Istanbul, and a good platform for correspondence.
What was once the ancient city of Smyrna is today a modern commercial centre, developed and vibrant, located around an enormous bay, surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, the glass buildings and modern shopping centres are dotted with traditional red tiled roofs, the old market of the 17th century, and old mosques and churches, although the city has a Mediterranean atmosphere which reminds more of Europe than the traditional Turkish city.

There are still many people alive who survived their stay here, and many others who saw their loved ones killed or killed by forced labour, Jews or not Jews, regardless of their religion.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Don't make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Don't deface the site by painting or scratching graffiti on the structures.
Barcelona's official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population speaks Catalan, most understand it, and most people can speak Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, because the law establishes that it is the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan, but disruptive events are announced by an automated system in many languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
The Parisians have long been known to be egocentric, rude and arrogant.
Although this stereotype is often inaccurate, the best way to get along in Paris is to behave well, to act as someone of good manners. This will make it much easier for you to travel.
The brusque exteriors of the Parisian people disappear quickly if you show a modicum of courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely wooded, mainly of beech, pine and oak, and presents a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
The country has a great variety of plant communities because of the diversity of its microclimates, soils and altitudes.
The region also supports a very large variety of animal and bird species.
Rare animals such as the brown bear of Europe, the wolf, the owl, the lynx, the wild cat and the great tit can be seen there, as well as many common species.
When they visit a monastery, women must cover their knees and cover their shoulders as well.
Most monasteries provide shawls to women who arrive without anything, but if you bring your own shawl, and if it is brightly coloured, you will get a smile from the monk or nun at the door.
As men must wear trousers that cover their knees.

Therefore, the reading of this introduction to Persian grammar would help you to learn a lot about Persian grammar and to better understand the phrases.
It is obvious that if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn the Portuguese.
However, those who speak a little Spanish might conclude prematurely that the Portuguese is sufficiently close to Spanish to be studied separately.
Premodern observatories are generally obsolete today, and remain as museums or educational sites.
As the light pollution of their day was not as serious as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, easier to access than those built in the modern era.
Modern telescopes are enormous infrastructures placed in remote regions where the conditions are favorable.
Hanami, the Japanese tradition of viewing the cherry blossoms, is part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where plum blossoms were the favorite flower.

Many traditions associated with these festivals have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians throughout the world.
It is customary to sleep out in the open at dawn to watch the sunrise.
There are certainly Christian explanations for this tradition, but it could well be that it is a spring and fertility ritual of pre-Christian times.
Traditional churches often hold a vigil on Easter Saturday night during the Easter weekend, often breaking into the party at midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that have arrived on these islands have arrived originally by water, swimming or by air.
Because of the great distance between the continent and the animals, the mammoths could not go all the way, making the giant tortoise the main animal of pasture on the Galapagos Islands.
From the arrival of man to the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including cattle, horses, cows, sheep, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will be able to witness the polar night, during which the sun does not rise above the horizon.
It is a good opportunity to admire the auroras borealis, because the sky will be overcast almost all day.
