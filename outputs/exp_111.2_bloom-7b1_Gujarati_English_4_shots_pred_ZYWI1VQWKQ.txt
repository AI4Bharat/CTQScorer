When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from its main group (for example, they move to a mountain or a river when they leave their home, or they move to a new island where they cannot return) they are exposed to a new environment.
These are two very different things. The new environment has different sources and competitors, so the new generation needs stronger competitors, they need to have the same facilities or the same environment as they had before.
The basic population hasnt changed much, they still need the same kind of basic amenities.
Over time, new populations will become more adapted to their new environment, and will become less and less visible.
Finally, millions of years later, the two populations will look different enough to be considered different species.

Animals, such as primates, who have a digestive system similar to humans, are unable to obtain the amino acids they need from plants.
But failure to do so would have serious consequences: growth depression, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources are the leaves and seeds, but if they are cooked, they are not easily digestible for humans and animals.
Contrary to this, livestock feed (worms, ticks, insects) is only easily digested by animals but they provide high quality protein that is rich in all amino acids.
However, it should not be surprising that our forefathers, today, would have solved the problem of the Champa king in the same manner as they solved the protein problem.
