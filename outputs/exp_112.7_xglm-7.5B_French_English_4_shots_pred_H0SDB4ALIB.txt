It confirms not only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but provides details that the fossils cannot usually provide, such as the colour and the three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this bird's feathers were brown-tan on the top and pale or carotenoïde on the bottom.
This discovery also allows us to better understand the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a fully developed root, which is called a tail, but show other characteristics of feathers – beards and barbules – the researchers have concluded that the root was probably an evolutionary development later on.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight, but rather for regulation or display of temperature. The researchers have suggested that even if it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not the feathers of a chick.
Scientists say that this is certainly the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, but the sample reveals a feather belonging to an adult, not a juvenile.
A car bomb exploded at the headquarters of the police in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.

His other slalom race, the giant slalom, enabled him to finish tenth in the women's sitting group with a combined time of 4:41.30, or 2:11.60 minutes less than the Austrian Claudia Loesch, who was first, and 1:09.02 minutes less than the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani, who was ninth
In the category of women sitting skiers, four skiers were unable to finish their race; in the slalom, 45 skiers on a total of 117 skiers were unable to place themselves in the top ten.
The police in Madhya Pradesh have recovered the laptop and mobile phone stolen.
The Assistant Inspector General D. K. Arya said: "We have arrested five people for violating the Swiss national, and we have recovered her mobile phone and her laptop.
The accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the police commissioner, said that the people accused had their faces covered when they appeared before the court.
While three people were present in the house when the car hit it, no one was injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured to the head.
The road where the accident took place was temporarily closed to allow emergency services to extract the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was then taken to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been indicted for the murder of her son by the Sheriff Court of Edinburgh.
She is in custody awaiting trial and awaiting her indictment, but eyewitness testimony could be compromised because her portrait has been widely disseminated.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but the Scottish courts operate differently and have considered that publishing photographs was potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, of Dundee University, notes that "journalists seem to follow a dangerous line if they publish photographs, etc. of suspects.
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is responsible for all prosecutions, has said that no further comment will be made at least until the prosecution is brought.
According to the leak, the document will deal with the dispute at the border that the Palestinians claim based on the existing borders before the Middle East war of 1967.
In addition to the other topics discussed, the future state of Jerusalem is sacred for both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel requires a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of 10 years from the signing of an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority only agrees to a five-year term.
The shooters of the additional parasite test were closely monitored by rangers, because the test was controlled and its effectiveness was evaluated.
In the context of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) inc., qualified volunteers have been recruited, in the context of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, temporary conservation manager for the NPWS, the four shooters named for the first shooting campaign have been properly trained and instructed in safety procedures.
Martelly has just appointed a provisional Electoral Council (CEP) consisting of nine members.
It is the fifth PEC of Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the dissolution of the previous CEP in the context of a set of measures aimed at engaging the country on the road to new elections.
This Commission was the response of Martelly to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The demonstrations sometimes violent were triggered by the absence of elections, some of which were to take place in 2011.
About 60 iPods overheating cases have been reported, resulting in six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been informed of 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, the METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which it described as "non-serious.
The Ministry of Health has responded by calling it "really regrettable" that the report was postponed." # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #
The earthquake struck the Mariannes at 7:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday)
The Emergency Management Agency of the Northern Mariana Islands has declared that no damage has been reported in this country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has taken hostages from Hong Kong tourists in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at tourists.
Many hostages have been saved, and at least six of them have been confirmed to have died so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released prematurely, as well as the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the loo. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and decided to become a doctor.
He followed a training course in obstetrics, and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When he was working at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature births during his free time. 
His research has shown that if a hormone is administered, it would accelerate the pulmonary maturation of the baby.
Xinhua reported that the government investigators recovered two flight recorders (black boxes) on Wednesday.
Other fighters also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Queen of the extreme. My first manager. Luna is dead at two moons. A unique moment, just like she. A strong woman.
Dustin 'Goldust' Runnels commented that "Luna was as strange as me... or even more... I love her and she will be missed... I hope she rests in a better place.
A survey conducted among 1,400 people before the federal elections of 2010 revealed that the number of opponents to the transformation of Australia into a republic had increased by 8 % since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the federal election campaign that she thought Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 per cent of those interviewed share this view, and wish that Queen Elizabeth II is the last monarch to rule Australia.
At the extremes, 29% of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
Olympic gold medallist was due to swim in 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical condition was questioned.
He could not take the necessary medicines to overcome his pain, as they were banned within the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25,
Many people have checked the discovery using different materials and software at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Cosmic comets may have been a source of water for the earth, as well as organic matter which can form proteins and promote life.
The scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, and in particular how the Earth was formed, because comets have collided with it for a long time.
Cuomo, 53 years old, began his term as governor in January and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He has described the rumours as 'political babble'.
We think he will be the next President.
According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that would allow aircraft to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
It is based on satellite technology, and not on ground-based radar systems used previously, which enables air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more detailed information.
The additional transport is non-existent and the surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and the parking and railway stations are not available on the ground.
The fear of not having enough transport has led to the possibility that the match could be played behind closed doors, without the supporters of the teams.
A study published on Thursday in Science has revealed the origin of a new species of bird in the Galápagos Islands equatorianas.
Researchers from Princeton University in the US and Uppsala University in Sweden have indicated that the new species had evolved in only two generations, although this process had been estimated much longer, due to the reproduction between a Darwin's finch endemic, Geospiza fortis, and the finch immigrant with conical beak, Geospiza conirostris.
You can shape gold in many ways. It can be rolled into small pieces.
It can be twisted and woven into fine threads. It can be hammered or laminated into sheets.
It can be made very fine, and glued onto another metal. It can be so fine that it has sometimes been used to decorate hand-painted images in manuscripts called "enlumined manuscripts.
That's what we call a chemical product's pH. You can make a pH indicator by using red cabbage juice.
Le jus de chou changes de couleur according to the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the chemical tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electron (because hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron)." #
Mix the dry powders together, then, with clean hands and moist ones, press them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the external layers, which will produce an odd sensation and produce a sort of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets equipped with a flush in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewer
Found remains of sewer systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, in Persia and China. In Roman times, public toilets sometimes made up part of public baths where men and women met.
When you call someone who is thousands of kilometres away, you use a satellite.
The satellite receives the call in space and then returns it to Earth almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts a part of our light and our vision.
A giant rocket is required to put a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in many ways. The greatest benefit it has brought us is to have made transport much simpler and faster.
It has brought us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Below are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, including rabbits, deer and other cattle.
In addition, there are many small cats (including free-roaming cats) that eat small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a special task assigned to each feline, preventing it from competing with other.
The lions are the most sociable cats, living in large groups called herds.
The packs are composed of one to three adult males, as well as a thirty-some females and cubs.
Women are generally very close to each other, their family being made up of a large number of sisters and daughters.
The lions act like packs of wolves or dogs, very similar to lions (but not to other large cats) in their behaviour, and also very deadly for their prey.
Balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (but sometimes very difficultly), swim, jump great distances and pull with five times the strength of a human powerful.
The tiger is part of the same family (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones capable of roaring.
The roar of the tiger does not resemble the roar of the lion, but rather to a phrase whose words would be cries and groans.
The ocelot is fond of small animals. It catches monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if it can. Almost all animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than him.
According to scientists, ocelots sniff out prey (prey) by smelling their tracks on the ground.
They see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision, and they move also very stealthily. The ocelots hunt their prey by blending into their environment before leaping on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it is derived (for example, if it moves above a mountain range or river, or if it moves to a new island so that it cannot easily return to the mainland), it often finds itself in a different environment than it was previously.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so that the new population will need new characteristics or adaptations to be a powerful competitor compared to what it had before.
The population of origin has not changed at all, it has always needed the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they will no longer be considered to belong to the same species.
We call this process "speciation", which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (which is to say, exhale).
Plants produce their food by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The giant squid was the superpredator of the time, it did not fear anything, except other giant squid.
His long jaws were equipped with more than 70 sharp teeth, as well as a series of teeth in the palate, so that anything that crossed his path could not escape.
We are not sure, but it may have been a bit tongue-tied." His diet included large fish, other plesiosaurs, and possibly even cannibalism.
He also attacked everything that entered the water; even a dinosaur like a T. rex was not big enough against him.
While the Romans ate what we know, they ate strange or unusual dishes, including snakes, pigeons, snails, and slugs, as well as the hare, a sort of rodent.
Another difference: while the poor and the woman ate their food sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to organise banquets where they rested on the side while they ate.
Roman meals of antiquity could not include these foods from America or Asia that were introduced into Europe centuries later.
For example, they did not have wheat, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no Roman never tasted a lamb.
Babylonians built temples for each of their gods which were regarded as the dwellings of the god.
People sacrificed to the gods and priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had a courtyard, then a inner sanctum, which only priests could enter.
Some pyramids, the ziggurats, were sometimes built as part of a temple.
The summit of the tower was a special place for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
The bulk of the Jewish family’s life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the court; shops were only open counters giving on to the street. Houses were built of stone. 
As there were no large forests in Canaan, the wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In Scandinavian sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder he found Greenland and named it after him.
But regardless of its discovery, the Eskimo people lived there already at the time.
While each country is'scandinavian', there are many differences between the people, the kings, the customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the film Benjamin Gates and the Templar Treasure, you may think that a treasure map has been drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that is not true. Although there is a stamp on the back of the document, it is not a treasure chest card.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, it read: "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4 July 1776." The text is on the reverse.
While no one really knows who wrote it, we know that at an early stage of its existence, the great scroll (which measures approximately 29 inches three quarters on 24 inches) was rolled up. 
It is therefore highly likely that the rating was added simply as an identifier.
The landing day and the subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
She was ruled by French Vichy, French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupying power instead of facing it.
On August 15, 1940, Allied forces landed in the south of France, Operation "Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French Forces had liberated the south of France and were heading for Germany.
A civilisation is a unique culture shared by a large number of people who live and work in cooperation, a society.
The word 'civilisation' derives from the Latin word 'civis', which means 'citizen' and is related to the Latin words 'civitas', which means 'city' or'state' and which also indicates, in some way, the size of the society to which it relates.
Cities-states are the pioneers of nations. A civilisational culture involves the transmission of knowledge on several generations, a durable cultural empreinte and an equitable diffusion.
Minority cultures disappear often without leaving any historically relevant traces and are not recognized as genuine civilizations.
In the revolutionary war, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government — the Congress being its only component — by virtue of the Articles of the Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes and, as there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on the authorities of the state, often less cooperative, to enforce all its acts.
He did not have the power to derogate from tax laws nor from customs laws between the Member States.
The articles required unanimous consent of all the Member States before they could be amended and the Member States took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, with Germany's national team, the second most successful team in the world and they have won the World Cup in 2006.
In popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, equestrian, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1.
Skiing is the most popular sport in the northern regions, Italians participating in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has more than 7 000 islands (the largest being Honshu), which makes it the seventh-largest island in the world!
Because of its group of islands, Japan is often referred to, geographically, as an 'archipelago'.
The first information about Taiwan dates back to the fifteenth century, while European sailors passing through it made mention of it as Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the south-west of Taiwan, introducing a transformation of traditional practices of rice and sugarcane production, and employing Chinese workers to work in its plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared them province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat during the first Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Treaty, by which it ceded Taiwan to Japan, which was then ruling the island until 1945.
The Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the sun temple and the three windows.
Most of the neighbouring buildings have been rebuilt to provide better views of their original appearance.
In 1976, 30% of the Machu Picchu had been restored and this restoration continues to the present day.
For example, the most common format of photographic film is 35 mm; it was the most common format of film used at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still made today, but what is important is that its image format is inherited from the format of the digital camera's sensor.
The 35 mm format is actually 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
So, we say that the aspect ratio of this format is 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, APS family) are equal to this aspect or approach it.
The third-country rule, which has been so badly mistreated and often ridiculed, is a simple directive that offers dynamism while at the same time providing protection.
He says that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the vertical and horizontal lines dividing the image.
In this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was being questioned.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has bound the European states together despite the differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power touched everyone, from the king to the peasants.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to relieve suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds are there specifically for this reason.
The central church authority was in Rome for more than 1000 years and this concentration of power and money has led many people to ask whether this doctrine was respected.
After the outbreak of hostilities, Britain established a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategy has proven effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade has been flagrantly violating international law generally accepted and codified by several international agreements of the two last centuries.
Britain is trying to block international waters in order to prevent ships from venturing into entire areas of international waters, which is a threat even for neutral ships.
As this tactic has not elicited a timid reaction, Germany expected a similar reaction from its underwater warfare without limits.
In the 20th century, most citizens and nations showed a preference for pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of the War during the First World War, nations wished to avoid a similar situation recurring in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four hundred in his name, a poetry book and a recommendation letter from Charles Batchelor (his previous employer) to the attention of Thomas Edison.
The ancient Chinese had a unique way of showing the different periods of China or each family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
There were also periods of instability in provinces divided into dynastic periods. The most well-known of these periods is the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
In these periods, fierce battles have taken place between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms were one of the bloodiest periods in Chinese history. Thousands of people died in battle to sit on the throne of the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political repercussions such as the use of the metric system, the passing from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people and not to one single leader.
As well, after the Revolution, the professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and the most talented to succeed.
It goes without saying that the army, because the ranking of armies is no longer based on class, but on calibre.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed workers in other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions that transcended the world of this life. He had a habit of going to a cave that became famous under the name of 'Hira' on the mountain of 'Noor' (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which survived the time, gives a very vivid picture of the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
located at the top of one of the mountains in the north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find, even if we know that it exists. When we entered the cave, we are completely isolated. 
Up there, you can only look at the clear sky and the numerous mountains surrounding it. From the inside of the cave, you can only see or hear very little of this universe.
The Great Pyramid of Gizeh is the only of the seven wonders that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians during the third millennium BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many gigantic structures erected in honour of the Pharaohs who died.
The Giza plateau, or 'Giza necropolis', in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, contains several pyramids (the largest being the most imposing), several small tombs, many temples and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built to honour the Pharaoh Khéops, and many small pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honour his wives as well as his family.
The symbol 'push' looks like a V and the symbol 'pull' looks like a staple or a square with a missing bottom.
The top means you must start with the tip and push the bow, and the bottom means you must start with the arrow and pull the bow.
A bow produces a more pleasant sound when it is raised, whereas a bow raised to the top is more powerful and more assertive.
Don't be afraid to write your own mark on the pencil, but remember that printed pencil marks are for a musical reason, and you should therefore generally respect them.
On 6 October 1789, King Louis XVI, his wife Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old) and the sister of the king, Madame Elisabeth, all terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by
In a carriage, they went back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and screamed threats against the king and the queen.
The king and queen were forced to open the windows of their carriages because of the crowd.
At a certain point, a crowd member brandished the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles before the terrified queen.
The American imperialist war expenditures in the Philippines have been paid by the people of the Philippines themselves.
They were forced to pay colonial US taxes to cover a large part of the expenses and interest of the Philippine government bonds issued by Wall Street banks.
Of course, the superprofits derived from prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people could constitute the fundamental benefits of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context in which they were created.
These events took place during the period generally considered to be the High Middle Ages – a period of European history that ran from the eleventh to the thirteenth century (1000-1300).
The Middle Ages Central preceded the High Middle Ages and followed by the Low Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from the technological push or the technological imperative to a strict sense of the term which states that the destiny of humanity is determined by a logical underpinning linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies.
Many interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: technological development itself is a process that transcends cultural and political influences, and technology has an impact on societies that are intrinsically conditioned rather than socially.
For example, one could say that the automobile leads necessarily to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a few cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Massive ownership of cars also leads to an increased incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the area of health care for treating body injuries.
Romanticism presented an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
According to Romantic theories, geography would have shaped individuals and, over time, customs and a culture associated with this geography would have emerged. These, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris is known as the capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was regarded as the capital of the medieval Europe.
His reputation as the centre of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until 1100 AD.
His status has declined over the twelfth century, mainly because of the fact that Crusaders were returning with presents such as silk and spices, with which Byzantine markets could not compete.
It was at this time that the title of capital of fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic architecture reached its peak between the 10th and 11th century and the 14th century.
At first, the dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture, east of.
However, due to the slowness of communication means, Western modes could be behind by 25 to 30 years.
In the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time, following the crusades, was the use of buttons for closing clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is a form of agriculture practised to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Sustainable agriculture is a simple system, often organic, using heirloom seeds from the region, combined with rotational farming or other simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers practised subsistence farming and that is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures gather people feeling neglected by social norms and sharing the same ideas which enables them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnic origin, class, location and / or sex of members.
The criteria that determine a subculture as distinct from the mainstream culture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
A subculture often signals its membership by distinctive and symbolic use of style, which encompasses fashion, mannerisms and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialisation is to draw on a few unfortunate cases of children who, by neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse, have not been socialised by adults during their childhood.
Those children are considered to be 'wild' or'savages'. Some children who are wild have been locked up by people (usually their own parents) ; in some cases, the abandonment of this child was due to the rejection by parents of a severe intellectual or physical disability which the child suffered.
Wild children may have suffered serious abuse or trauma before being abandoned or escaping.
Others would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in the wild.
When they are raised entirely by non-human species, wild children display almost the same behaviours as those of their human carers, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
As learning projects should make learning easier and more interesting, the support goes further.
Support is not a method of learning, but rather a means of helping learners who discover a new teaching method such as the use of a new programme or the start of a new project.
Supports can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but the little Microsoft Office trombone is also a form of support.
Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are intended to guide, explain and guide students through procedures that could have been too difficult to manage by the student alone.
Children are placed in foster care for very diverse reasons, from neglect to maltreatment, from extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, attentive and educational, but that is the case.
We perceive family planning as a safe zone for these children.
Our family placement system is supposed to provide safe, loving homes, stable carers, stable education and reliable healthcare.
The placement in a family home is intended to provide all the essentials that were lacking in the home from which they had previously been removed.
Internet combines mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approach to use and gratification.
For example, 'learning' and'socialisation' are seen as major factors promoting Internet use (James et al., 1995).
‘Personal involvement’ and ‘continued relationships’ have also been identified as being new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied the public reaction to websites.
Video recording has led to great discoveries in the interpretation of facial expressions, which are micro-expressions during a few milliseconds.
They claim that one can detect if a person is lying by interpreting correctly the micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, has said how people with cerebral lesions are able to assess the sincerity of the speech accurately.
He suggests that such human behavioural interpretation abilities may be found in domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two genetic reservoirs: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and the selection removes it from the gene pool of expressed variations.
Gender segregation and recombination alternate between the two watersheds at each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a non-human primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet his or her amino acid needs from the available plant resources.
In addition, a lack of reaction has serious consequences: growth problems, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The most easily accessible resources would be the proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult to digest for us, unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal-origin foodstuffs (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest and provide a large amount of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
In all fairness, we should not be surprised if our own forefathers have solved their 'protein problem' in a similar way that chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep deprivation is the process of intentional awakening during your sleep and subsequently falling asleep for a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
It can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock, so that you do not wake up completely.
If you get woken up by the clock going back to zero, it can be placed on the other side of the room, making it impossible for you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other possibilities based on the biorhythm include drinking a lot of liquids before going to bed (for example, water or tea, reputed to be diuretics), which forces you to wake up to urinate.
The degree of peace within a person is opposed to the degree of tension in his or her body and mind.
When the tension is low, the vital force present is positive. Everyone has the opportunity to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way is our own tension and our negativeness.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been enriched by the path of mahayana love and by many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the universal love path.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (illumination energy) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
Tibetan meditation centres are the yoga of the deity. It is through visualising different deities that the channels of energy are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of awakening is created.
Germany was a common enemy during the Second World War, which led to the cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, deep conflicts between their different systems, methods and cultures ended the entente between these two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies have become enemies and the cold war has begun.
It would last for the next 40 years and see real conflicts, through substitute armies, on battlefields as well in Africa as in Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defence was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganise along the Romanian front.
But these plans have become obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800 000 Soviet soldiers arrived and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian bielorussian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, as well as other international treaties, bilateral or multilateral, that they be bilateral or multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient means of transporting large quantities of people and goods through oceans.
The work of the armed forces has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the capacity to move your people and your goods, while interfering with your enemy's capacity to move people and goods.
One of the most recent examples of this situation has been the campaign North Atlantic during the Second World War. The Americans were trying to cross the Atlantic Ocean to help the British.
At the same time, the German Navy, using mainly U-Boats, tried to stop this trade.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Great Britain as it did for the rest of Europe.
It seems that the sheep were domesticated for the first time about 10 000 years ago in the Zagros mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribal groups began to keep them close to them to have easy access to milk, fur, skins and meat.
Domestic sheep were usually kept in herds that wandered on the hills or other pasture areas, often cared for by shepherds who were usually children or adolescents, similar to the more familiar term of shepherds. These pastoral methods have always existed today.
The 'wagonways' were built in England in the 16th century.
While the railway tracks were simply made of parallel boards, they allowed horses to pull them faster and to pull heavier loads than on the slightly more accident-prone roads of the day.
The crossbars were introduced early to keep the tracks in place. However, it was soon apparent that the tracks would be more effective if they were equipped with a steel bar on top.
It has become a common practice, but iron has caused more wear on the wooden wheels of wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails were introduced.
The first means of locomotion was walking: humans began walking upright about two million years ago with the arrival of the Homo Erectus ("right-handed man").
Their predecessors, the australopithecines, did not walk upright as they usually did.
There are bipedal specializations in fossils of Australopithecus afarensis from 4,2 to 3,9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs already seven million years ago.
We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even campaign to reduce the suffering to come.
In many cases, it is a symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not wish to merely have a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems and disable them.
It is clear that the world has changed greatly thanks to the scientific and technological achievements made by human beings, and that the problems have become more serious because of the overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
After its adoption by the Congress on 4 July, a draft signed by the Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to a few blocks away, to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
Over the course of the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, known as "Dunlap Broadsides.
The first reading was made by John Nixon in the Independence Hall courtroom on July 8,
One of them was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who read it to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy was received in London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap leaves that are known to exist are the oldest known copies of the document. The original manuscript has not survived.
Many palaeontologists now believe that a dinosaur group survived and is still alive. They are called birds.
A very few people regard them as dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly.
But there are still many birds that look like dinosaurs.
They have scales on their feet and claws, they lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that are coded in binary form.
A binary number can only have one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary numbers, or bits to use the computer jargon.
An internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are sufficiently general to allow a diagnosis to be made without delay.
The best indicator of internal poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of toxic household chemicals or medicines.
Look at the label to find out the first aid instructions specific to this poison.
The term 'insect' is used by entomologists in a formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
This term derives from an old familiarity with bed bugs, which are very adapted to parasitize humans.
The flies, like bed bugs, are nidicolous, that is to say, they are adapted to live in the nest or the host's home.
In the United States, there are approximately 400 000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the principal neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
Spinal cord injury is a central nervous system disease that affects the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A couple can very well feel that it is not in their interest, nor in the child's interest, to take care of the child's education.
These couples can choose to make a baby adoption plan.
In a child adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main objective of science is to understand how the world works through scientific method. This method guides in fact most scientific research.
It is, however, not the only, experimentation, and an experiment is a test that serves to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, pose questions and make observations, but it also orients the scientific research.
Naturalist and philosophers have focused on ancient texts, and in particular on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's opinions on all scientific questions, including psychology, were accepted.
With the decline of Greek knowledge, Western civilization has been cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behaviour depend in large part on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which do not simply represent periodic responses to external stimuli, have been found for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to operate for a certain period even without external stimulation.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used viruses, or phages, to implant their own DNA into a bacteria.
They have carried out two experiments to mark either the phage DNA with a radioactive phosphorus, or the phage protein with a radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the extent of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only germline mutations can be passed on to children, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism is aimed at visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, including wildlife and flora.
Hunting, fishing, bird watching, bird watching, park visits, and studying the information on the ecosystem are examples of activities on the spot.
You can, for example, go to see, photograph and discover the orang-utans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the countryside small towns in cars to get to their place of work and cross other people who are going to work in the country they have just left.
In this dynamic passenger transport system, each is in some way connected to a vehicle-based transport system based on private cars and supports it.
The science now shows that this massively carbon-based economy has driven the biosphere out of its stable state that has supported human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about water quality or bridge collapses.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they break down every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flows are the study of the movements of drivers and private vehicles between two points, and the interactions they exercise between themselves.
It is unfortunately difficult to study the flow of traffic, because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with 100 % certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act within a reasonable range; thus, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically approximatively.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) the flow, (2) the density and (3) the speed.
These relationships help to plan, design, and operate road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly enabled them to escape more easily from their enemies and to find more effectively food and companions.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their bodies.
It gives them a greater number of small hiding places from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and the ephemerals.
There are some thousands of years ago, a man called Aristotle asserted that the solar system moved around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system moved around the earth, including the sun (and even the other stars).
It seems reasonable, because the Earth does not feel like it is moving, is that not?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times the volume of water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the largest river in the world, reaching up to 10 km wide.
About 20% of the water that falls from rivers on the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main branch of the Amazon River is 6387 km (3980 miles). It collects the water of thousands of small rivers.
While the construction of pyramids in stone continued until the end of the Ancient Empire, the Great Pyramid of Gizeh has never been surpassed in its size and the technical excellence of its construction.
Ancient Egyptians were enchanted by the monuments of their predecessors, who had then been around for more than a thousand years.
Vatican City has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and the least populated.
The Vatican City State drafts its legislation and official communications in Italian.
Italian is also the language of everyday use by most of the people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
The citizens of the Vatican City are all Catholic.
From antiquity, people have been familiar with basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, because they are found in nature in their pure form and are relatively simple to mine using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, has theorised that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. It was earth, water, air and fire.
It was rather the four states of matter (in the same order) : solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although he also made the theory that these latter are transformed into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered as metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys which contain a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of minuscule particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that billions of them could enter into the period at the end of this sentence.
So, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it was released.
Unfortunately, the emergence of new modes of writing has relegated the pen to a more private status and to less frequent uses.
People are now writing messages on computers, without ever having to approach a pencil.
We can only wonder what the keyboard will be like when the next new thing comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it transforms energy into assembling a nucleus of a myriad of protons and neutrons.
Like if you were to make a hill climb by dragging a heavy cart up a steep hill.
Some atoms have a volatile nucleus, so they tend to break up with little or no pressure.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust. Its outer layer is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the visible side and 100 km on the hidden side.
It is thinner at sea level and thicker under the continents.
There may be more lava on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are concerned with the search for what makes people feel good or attracted.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they matured into adulthood.
These theories examine what drives some people to want what they do and what drives their environment to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and the two-factor theory of Herzberg.
Generally speaking, two behaviours can emerge when a manager becomes the boss of former colleagues. From one end of the spectrum being to try to stay "the good friend" (or "the good friend's wife")." #
This type of manager is not able to take controversial decisions, carry out disciplinary actions, carry out evaluations, delegate responsibilities, and hold others responsible.
At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an individual who feels that he/she must change everything that the group has created up to now and do things his/her way.
After all, the boss is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behaviour often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same high standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet at different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
A real "invisible" team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the team of management that each member reports to. It sets the standards for each of them.
Why would an organisation want to create a structure for learning? One of the objectives of implementing organisational concepts of learning is innovation.
When all the resources are used effectively in functional services of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can be expressed fully.
Thus, a process of working together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovative process to meet the customer's need.
Before an organisation can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and its own culture of learning.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organisations achieve better results.
Neurobiological data provide material evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. They therefore allow for a reduction in the field of research and make it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of damage, lesions, tumours and brain injuries affect behaviour and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
It gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although Artificial Intelligence is often strongly connoted with science-fiction, it is an important part of computer science that studies the behaviour, learning and adapting intelligently of a machine.
Artificial intelligence research aims at automating tasks requiring an intelligent approach.
In the examples are the control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to customer diagnostics and questions, as well as the recognition of writing, voice and face.
This practice has led to distinct disciplines, aimed at providing solutions to the daily problems of life.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and military, as it was put into use in several home computer software and video games.
Excursions are integral to any school. Often, a teacher would like to take his students to places where a bus journey is not possible.
The solution is provided by the technology in the form of virtual educational outings. Students can watch the ancient objects of a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a beautiful work of art while sitting in their class.
Participating practically to a trip is also an excellent way of thinking about a trip and sharing your experiences with future generations.
For example, students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design each year a website dedicated to their visit to the capital of the state. Each year, the website is updated, but the old versions are kept online for use as an album.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Even if students often try blogging with poor grammar and spelling, having a public audience usually makes the situation better.
As students are often the most critical audience, the author of the blog is trying to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging "forces students to better know the world around them". The need to stimulate public interest encourages students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a useful tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning well beyond the traditional school day.
When used effectively, blogs can enable students to strengthen their analytical and critical thinking skills: by responding actively to online content, they can confront their own opinions with those of others and expose their own points of view on specific topics.
Ottawa is the charming capital bilingual of Canada and has a large number of art galleries and museums that highlight the past and present of Canada.
You will find further south the falls of Niagara and further north, the Muskoka region and its environs which possess a virgin natural beauty.
All these measures, and many more, make Ontario what foreigners regard as the quintessence of Canada.
Greater zones further north are quite sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited in the wild.
For a comparison of the population that is more than a little surprising: There are more African-Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The islands of the East African coast lie in the Indian Ocean, close to the African coast.
Madagaskar is the largest country, and even a continent by itself, in terms of fauna.
The majority of small islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known for being luxury beach resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam into the land and this religion has spread widely to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route which connects Europe to India.
North, the region is defined by the Sahara Desert, and to the south and east by the Atlantic Ocean.
To women: It is recommended that any woman who travels say that she is married, regardless of her civil status.
It is also advisable to wear a wedding ring (which should not seem too precious.
Women must realize that some cultural differences can lead to behaviours they consider as harassment. It is indeed common for them to be followed, caught by the arm, etc.
Be firm in your refusal of advances, and don't be afraid to hold your ground (cultural differences or not, that does not mean it is acceptable!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Ptolemies, the Romans and the Medes as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese, who after it had been destroyed it had been rebuilt and named Casa Branca, abandoned it in 1755 after a quake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city under the name of Daru l-Badya, and it was renamed Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in all of Morocco for shopping.
Around the old medina, it is easy to find places where you can buy traditional Moroccan products, such as tajines, pottery, leather goods, and all sorts of handmade jewellery, but it is all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located in the extreme east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city centre.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, all visits to the outside of Goma should be subject to investigation to understand the state of the fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of Nyiragongo volcano as well as for tracking gorillas in the mountains among the least expensive in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motor taxi) to get around in Goma. The normal fare (local) is about 500 CFA for a small trip.
Combined to its relative remoteness, "Tombouctou" has become a metaphor for distant and exotic countries.
Today, Tombouctou is a poor city, although its reputation as a tourist attraction makes it a draw, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the World Heritage List as a threatened site due to the desert sands threat.
It was one of the main steps in the emission of "Wonders of the African World" by Henry Louis Gates on the PBS.
The city contrasts markedly with the towns of the rest of the country, because it has a style more Arab than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the southern border is the Crocodile River." #
The total area of the park is 19 500 km2, it is divided into 14 ecozones, each of which contains a specific fauna.
This is one of the most famous South African National Parks and regarded as the jewel in the SANParks crown.
As for all South African national parks, there are daily entry and conservation fees.
It may be advantageous to purchase a Wild Card which gives access to some South African national parks, as well as all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the namesake of Hong Kong and represents the main centre of interest for many tourists.
The row of skyscrapers that forms the horizon of Hong Kong was compared to a glittering bar chart, which is revealed by reflection in the harbour of Victoria.
To admire the most beautiful panoramas of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to Kowloon's seafront located opposite.
The majority of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the north-western harbour front.
This is the place that the British colonists have invested. Thus, it seems to be a good point of departure, if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this region.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest mangrove forest belt, extending for 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the back-country of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans were declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of the forest located on Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are, however, not only made up of mangrove swamps: they also contain some of the last vestiges of the majestic jungles that covered the Ganges plain once.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3 850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water/wetlands.
Sundarbans is a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, you will find about 400 Bengal tigers and 30 000 striped hyenas.
Buses leave the inter-city bus station (situated on the other side of the river) throughout the day, but most, in particular those that serve the east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6 and 7 a.m.
Inter-district buses are often full, so it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese ships, which are comfortable and robust.
The shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to get to places close by, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock Bridge is a suspension bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to link the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint George's in Guyana.
The two towers stand at a height of 83 metres; it is 378 metres long and has two 3,50 m wide lanes.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. The structure was completed in August 2011, but it was opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge should be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs posts will be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group living in what is now the eastern part of Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also practising subsistence agriculture.
Other tribes of the Chaco, such as the Guaycurú or the Payaguá, lived mainly on fishing, hunting or gathering.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, once called "the giant province of India", was born of the meeting between Spanish conquerors and indigenous peoples.
The Spanish inaugurated the period of colonization, which lasted three centuries.
From the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain a large part of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best teams and among the best players in polo in the world.
The biggest polo tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
In addition, tournaments and matches of lesser magnitude are sometimes organised here at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, see the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Isle of Man is the Manx pound (FKP), which is equivalent to a pound sterling (GBP).
Money can be exchanged only at the Stanley Bank, on the island of Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
The pound sterling is a widely accepted currency in the islands, while in Stanley, credit cards and American dollars are also often accepted.
On the nearby islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, even if it is possible that the British and American dollars will be accepted. Talk to the owners in advance to agree on a payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange money from the Maldives outside the islands, so change it before you leave the islands.
Montevideo being located south of the Equator, winter in the northern hemisphere corresponds to summer there and vice-versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical zone and summer temperatures exceeding 30 °C are common.
Winter can be misleadingly cold: temperatures rarely fall below zero, but wind and humidity combine to give the impression that it is colder than what the thermometer says.
There are no 'rainy' and 'dry' seasons: rainfall is pretty constant all year round.
Although many of the animals at the park are accustomed to seeing humans, they are still wild animals; please do not feed them or disturb them.
According to the park authorities, you must stay at least 100 meters from wolves and bears and at least 25 meters from all other wild animals!
As they may appear to be, the bison, the elk, the moose, the bear and almost all the great animals can attack.
Every year hundreds of visitors are injured because they did not keep a sufficient distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them some space.
In addition, know that odours attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking odours-laden foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of about 40 000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and is the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a naval tragedy in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
The Supreme Head Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was assassinated during a peaceful rally held in the city during the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement.
The beaches are numerous, because Auckland is on the border of two ports. The most popular ones are in three zones.
The North Shore beaches are on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay north to Devonport south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy and allow safe swimming, and most are shaded by Pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are on the Waitemata Harbour, in the chic suburb of Mission Bay and in Saint Heliers in the centre of Auckland.
The beaches, often very popular with families, have many shops along the coast. Swimming is safe there.
The main local beer is the 'Number One', a rather ordinary beer, but tasty and refreshing. There is also another local beer, the 'Manta'.
There are many French wines to taste, but New Zealand and Australia wines may travel better.
You can drink the tap water locally without any danger, but you can easily find bottled water if you have any concerns about it.
For Australians, the idea of a ‘coffee cream’ is foreign. A black coffee is an ‘espresso’, a cappuccino is filled with cream (not foam) and the tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is Belgian standard compliant. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries caused by one of these causes on the reef are rare.
However, follow the advice of authorities, obey all signs and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
From October to April, north of 1770, the box jellyfish arrive near beaches and estuaries of rivers. They can also sometimes be seen outside of this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most of them are afraid of humans and would run away.
Salmon crocodiles do not live in the ocean, their main habitat is in estuary rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveller the peace of mind that he will have somewhere to sleep once he arrives at destination.
Travel agents often have special agreements with specific hotels, but you can also book accommodation through travel agents of other types of accommodation, such as camping sites.
Travel agencies usually offer packages including breakfast, airport transfers or even packages combining flight and accommodation.
They can also reserve a place for you if you need time to think about the offer or to procure other documents necessary for your destination (for example, a visa).
Any change or request should, however, be addressed to the travel agency first and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants decide to camp there, and most consider that it is an integral part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the musical event, you will have to arrive early to find a well-placed camping site.
Don't forget that even if the music concerts are over on the main stages, other music concerts can continue until late at night on other festival sites.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the North Sea in winter, be sure to check the location of the hut, because the ice may cause unbearable noises at the most exposed huts.
Cruises to St Petersburg include time spent in the city. Passengers on cruises are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos generally make a lot of effort to maximise the time and money spent by their customers. There are rarely windows and clocks, and exits can be difficult to spot.
They usually offer special offers of food, drinks and entertainment to keep the guests happy and to keep them at the party.
On some sites, it is the premises that offer free alcoholic beverages. However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good players should know that it is crucial to remain sober.
Anyone who drives to high latitudes or crosses mountains must consider the possibility of snow, ice or cold temperatures.
On the icy roads and icy pavements, friction is low and you cannot drive like you are on the asphalt.
While snowstorms can fall in very little time enough snow to block you.
The visibility can also be limited by snow or sleet or by condensation or ice on the windows of vehicles.
On the other hand, the presence of snow and ice is normal in many countries, and the road network is practically continuous all year round.
Safaris are perhaps the most popular tourist attraction in Africa and the most memorable moment for many visitors.
In everyday language, the term'safari' refers to an African excursion, and in particular to a wildlife safari, which aims to witness the spectacular spectacle of wild animals in their natural habitat.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach close to cars and standard equipment allows them to be observed.
Lion, cheetah and leopards are sometimes timid and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as 'walking safari', 'pedestrian safari' or 'footing') consists of walking, either for a few hours, or for several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will take place in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, after hosting the Games in 1964.
If you have booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you will be in a difficult position.
The policies of cancellation vary, but from mid-March most cancellation policies based on the coronavirus do not extend to July 2020, the date when the Olympic Games had been planned.
We expect most events tickets to cost between 2 500 and 130 000 yens, typical tickets costing around 7 000 yens.
When ironing wet clothes, it is easier to dry them. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards which can be borrowed, even if there is no iron in the room. 
If you do not have a iron or do not want to wear ironed socks, you can try to use a hair dryer, if you find one.
Avoid leaving the fabric too hot (which can cause its shrinkage or in extreme cases, to burn it).
There are different methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it is enough to boil the water for a minute; in others, it is necessary to boil it for several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you have a problem, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers can encounter dangerous animals they do not know in their home region.
Parasites can contaminate food, cause irritations or, in the most serious cases, cause allergic reactions, spread venom or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can wound or kill people by force, are not usually considered parasites.
In some areas, duty free shops present an opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and customs duties.
Travellers to destinations where taxes are high can sometimes make substantial savings, in particular on alcoholic beverages or tobacco.
The Buffalo-Pittsburgh section of the Interstate Highway System is the most difficult section of the highway to drive on, passing through isolated backcountry areas of the hinterland.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your eyes open: the steep gradients, narrow roads and tight bends predominate.
Speed limits displayed are significantly lower than in previous sections and following – usually between 35 and 40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and strict compliance with them is even more important than before.
On the other hand, mobile phone service is surprisingly much stronger here than on many other parts of the road, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cakes are rather good, and in Bavaria, they are very rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbour, Austria.
Fruit cakes are a common feature of the season: apples are baked and baked in cakes all year round, while pears and plums are in season in summer.
German breads also contain nuts, almonds and other nuts. Popular cakes are often particularly well suited to a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but tasty cakes, try the Berliners, also known as Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, according to regions.
A curry is a dish made up of herbs and spices, accompanied by meat or vegetables.
A curry dish can be'solid' or 'liquid', depending on the amount of sauce it contains.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in the south of India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesia having 17 000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines present in all of the country.
However, when this term is used without any other qualification, it tends to refer to food from the central and eastern parts of the island of Java.
Now, widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a range of simple dishes, the predominant flavours being the cacao beans, peppers, sugar (especially the locally produced sugar cane sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are foot rests for the rider, which hang from each side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability to the user, but they can pose a security problem: for example, the user's feet can get stuck in the footrest.
If a horse is thrown from a horse, but has a leg caught in the stirrup, he could be dragged if the horse escapes. To minimise this risk, a number of measures of security can be taken.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a flat sole and a narrow heel.
Others, such as English saddles, have safety bars which allow a rider to fall off the saddle if it is pulled back by a rider who falls.
Valley of Cochamó – The excellence destination for rock climbing in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with many different granite peaks and cliffs.
From the summits, the panoramas are spectacular. The alpinists around the world are discovering new routes practicable on the slopes, where the possibilities are limitless. 
Skiing and snowboarding are popular sports that involve sliding down a snowy slope with skis or snowboards attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity that has many fans, sometimes called'ski bums', who organise their entire holidays around skiing in specific places.
The idea of skiing is very ancient: paintings of prehistoric caves show skiers for some of 5 000 years ago!
Skiing as a sport has been practised at least since the 16th century; the first ski club in recreational skiing was founded in 1861 in Australia by Norwegians. 
Skiing: this activity is also called Nordic skiing, cross-country skiing or hiking.
It resembles alpine skiing, as well as alpine climbing, but does not include in general these activities which are practiced on rugged terrain and require the use of skis and boots much stiffer. 
Think of skiing as a similar hiking route.
In good conditions, you can go a little further than walking – but you will never reach the speeds of skiing without a heavy pack on a muddy track.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but containing many independent countries. In normal circumstances, travelling through several countries involves several visa applications and several passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, works a little like one country in this regard.
As long as you remain within this area, you can usually cross borders without having to go through passport controls.
In addition, having a Schengen visa means you do not need to apply separately for visas for each of the Member States of the area, which allows you to save time, money and administrative procedures.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique. Some tax authorities define items over 100 years old as antiquities.
The criteria vary according to where you are; in some parts of the world, as in North America, the age limit can be lower than that in force in Europe.
Artisanal products can be considered as antiquities even if they are less ancient than similar industrial products.
Reindeer herding is a major means of subsistence for the Samis and the culture surrounding this trade is of great importance to many other professions.
Although, according to tradition, all Samis have not been involved in large-scale reindeer herding, they lived mainly from fishing, hunting and other similar activities, while using reindeer mainly as livestock.
Today, many Samis practice modern occupations. Tourism is an important source of income in Lapland, the Sami region.
While widely used, in particular among non-Romas, the term 'Gitan' is often considered to be pejorative on the basis of its association with negative stereotypes and an unfair image of the Roma people.
If the country you are travelling to is subject to a travel warning issued by your government, your travel insurance abroad or your travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also consult other governments that yours, but their advice is tailored to their citizens.
As an example, US citizens in the Middle East could be faced with different situations from those faced by Europeans or Arabs.
The opinions are only a brief summary of the political situation of a country.
The opinions presented are often superficial, general and too simplified in relation to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Violent weather is the generic term for any dangerous meteorological phenomenon that may cause damage, social disruption or loss of life.
Very adverse weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and they can be of several kinds, depending on the geographical, topographical and meteorological characteristics.
Violent winds, heavy rain, excessive precipitation and fires are forms and effects of violent weather, just as thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes and cyclones.
Extreme weather phenomena, regional and seasonal, include cold winter storms, snowstorms with violent winds, and sandstorms or dust storms.
It is strongly recommended that travellers check the weather in their destination region, knowing that it may have an impact on their itinerary.
Anyone considering travelling to a country which could be considered a war zone should receive a vocational training.
A search for "Cours in hostile environment" may provide the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the issues raised here in much more detail, usually with a practical experience.
A training usually lasts for 2 to 5 days and includes role playing, lots of first aid, and sometimes a training in the use of weapons.
Wild survival books are commonplace, but war-zone survival books are very few.
Passengers planning to undergo a gender reassignment abroad should ensure that they have valid documents for their return journey.
The governments' desire to issue passports with the gender of the applicant (X) or to update documents to match the applicant's name and sex wishes varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honour these documents is also variable.
Security checkpoint searches have become much more intrusive in the era of post-11 September 2001.
Transgender people in the pre-op phase should not be expected to pass the body scanners in order to preserve their privacy and dignity.
Shore breakers are the waves that return from the breakers that break on the beach, often on a reef or equivalent.
Because of the underwater topography, the return flow is concentrated on a few deeper sections, and a fast current can form in the deep waters.
In most cases, deaths are due to exhaustion which results from trying to swim against the tide, which can be impossible.
When you leave the current, the return to swimming is not more difficult than usual.
Try to aim for a place where you will not be taken again. It is also possible that, depending on your skills and whether you have been spotted or not, you may want to wait for help.
The reintegration shock occurs earlier than the cultural shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have had a hard time adjusting to the new culture have sometimes a lot of trouble adjusting to their home culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and have lost some of your old habits.
At the beginning, when you travelled abroad, people probably were patient and understanding, knowing that travellers in a new country must adapt.
People may not be anticipating that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers and travelers returning home.
The light and sound show at the Pyramid is one of the most interesting attractions for children in the region.
You can see the pyramids in the darkness and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
Often, you hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The history of sound and light is like a book of history.
The Sphinx is placed as the backdrop and the narrator of a long history.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and the different pyramids are lit.
The Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the largest number of research stations and 16 of them are active in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the peninsula. The island of King George, with the village of Villa Las Estrellas, is the largest.
Other examples: Livingston Island and the disappointment, where the inland caldera of an active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbour.
Ellsworth Land is the eastern part of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula sink into the plateau, then reappear to form the Ellsworth Range, which runs for 360 km and passes through the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern chain, or Sentinel Range, contains the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which rises to 4892 m.
In remote areas without cellular network, you may not have any other choice than to use satellite telephony.
A satellite phone does not replace a mobile phone, because you need to be outside and have a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
It is a service often used by navigation, including boats, as well as by expeditions that require data transmission at a distance and telephony.
Your local telephone operator should be able to tell you more about the connection to this service.
Sabbatical planners have the opportunity to learn while travelling, and more and more of them choose this option.
This formula is particularly popular with young people who leave school, because it allows them to take a year off before university, without compromising their studies.
Often, having taken a year off to study abroad can actually give you better chances of going on to study at university in your country.
Generally, you have to pay tuition fees to take these educational programmes.
Finland is a popular destination for sailing. The "Land of the thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, in lakes and in coastal archipelagos.
You do not necessarily need a yacht in the archipelago and on the lake.
Although the coastal islands and the largest lakes are actually quite large for a boat, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Sailing is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden and New Zealand are in the same situation, but apart from that, it is a unique case (in the Netherlands, for example, the number is one to forty).
Most cruises on the Baltic Sea are characterized by a prolonged stay in St. Petersburg, in Russia.
It means you can visit the historic city for a few days, and then come back to sleep on the boat at night.
If you do not land on the ground only on cruise ships, you will not need a separate visa (from 2009).
Berlin, in Germany, is mentioned in some cruise brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not at all located near the sea and no visit to this city is included in the cruise price. 
Travelling by air can be a terrifying experience for all ages and from all walks of life, particularly if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
Don't be ashamed of it: it's not different from personal fears and fears that many people have about other things.
For some, understanding something about the workings of aircraft and what happens during a flight can help to overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or on the fact that you do not have control.
The fast-moving transport companies are well paid to deliver fast. In many cases, the question of time is crucial for documents, goods or spare parts that relate to them.
On some roads, large companies have their own aircraft, but on other roads and for small businesses, there has been a problem.
If they had shipped goods by air freight, on some routes, it would have taken days to clear customs and to get the goods to the destination.
The only way to make it faster was to send it as registered baggage. Airline regulations will not allow them to send a bag without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The easiest way to travel first class or business class is to pay a large sum of money for this privilege (or, better still, ask your company to do it for you).
However, that is not cheap: generally, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal fare for economy class, and eleven times for first class!
Generally, it is pointless to try to get discounts for business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that they can count on a certain type of passenger who are willing to pay very high prices for the privileges of speed and comfort and they set their prices accordingly.
The capital of the Republic of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is very common.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic state that is suffering from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, with its own government and its own currency, but recognized by no member of the United Nations.
The economic links between these two parts of Moldova have been restored despite the failure of the political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
With a population of 3.7 million, İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey, the second port after Istanbul, and a good platform for correspondence.
The ancient city of Smyrna is today a modern commercial centre, developed and living, located around an enormous bay, surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, the glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping centres are dotted with traditional red tiled roofs, the market from the eighteenth century, and old mosques and churches, although the city has a Mediterranean atmosphere reminiscent of Europe rather than the traditional Turkish one.
Haldarsvík is a small village on the island of Eysturoy, which offers views of the neighbouring island.
In the cemetery, there are interesting marble sculptures depicting doves on some graves.
It is worth walking around this fascinating village for half an hour.
The romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, located north, is easily accessible and has been made famous to foreigners by the vivid account of its splendour that Lord Byron made of it.
The bus 403 from Scotturb travels regularly to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
Going north, do not miss out on visiting the beautiful Fatima shrine (temple), a world-famous place for the appearances of Mary.
Don't forget that you are visiting a mass grave, as well as a site that has a very significant meaning for a significant proportion of the world's population.
There are still many women and men alive who have survived their stay here, and many others who have seen their loved ones killed or killed by forced labour, Jews or non-Jews alike.
Please treat this site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Don't make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Don't spoil the site by painting or scratching graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the residents prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and almost everyone is able to speak Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, because the law establishes that it is the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other installations.
Regular announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan, but unforeseen disruptions are announced by an automated system in many languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
The Parisians have the reputation of being egocentric, rude and arrogant.
While this stereotype is often inaccurate, the best way to get along in Paris is to behave well, act like someone of good manners. This will make your travels much easier.
The abrupt exteriors of Parisians disappear quickly if you show a modicum of courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely wooded, mainly of beech, pine and oak, and features a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
The country has a great variety of plant communities because of the diversity of its microclimates, soils and altitudes.
The region also contains a very large variety of animal and bird species.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the owl, the lynx, the bobcat, and the great tit can be seen there, as well as many common species.
When they visit a monastery, women must cover their knees and cover their shoulders as well.
Most monasteries provide shawls to women who arrive without anything, but if you bring your own shawl, and if it is brightly coloured, you will get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
As men should wear trousers that cover the knees.
You can also borrow this garment from the stock at the entrance, but as it is not washed after each use, it is possible that you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. A single size for men!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar regions in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (mainly pork), and relies on olive oil.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato and all the available condiments, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All names, followed by the word Sie which means you, begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
It is a good way of distinguishing between some verbs and objects.
It can also be said that it facilitates reading, although writing is a little bit complicated by the need to know whether a verb or an adjective is used as a substantive.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written
The most important letters to watch out for are the c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Please also ensure that you pronounce 'r' and 'rr' distinctly: 'caro' means 'dear', while 'carro' means 'chariot'.
The Persian language has a relatively easy grammar and most of the time regular.
Therefore, reading this introduction to Persian grammar would help you to learn a lot about Persian grammar and to better understand the phrases.
It is of course a given that if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, those who speak a little Spanish might conclude prematurely that Portuguese is sufficiently close to Spanish to be studied separately.
Premodern observatories are generally outdated today, and remain as museums or educational sites.
As the light pollution at the time was not as serious as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campus, easier to access than those built in the modern era.
Modern astronomical observatories are enormous infrastructures placed in remote regions where the weather conditions are favourable.
Hanami, the Japanese tradition of viewing cherry blossoms, is a part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept came from China where plum blossoms were the favourite flower.
In Japan, the first Cherry Blossom Festivals were held by the Emperor only for himself and his close circle of courtiers around the Imperial Palace.
Plants are their most beautiful when they are in a natural environment, resist the temptation to take just one.
If you visit a strictly designed garden, the collection of'specimens' will also make you evicted without discussion.
Singapore is generally considered to be an extremely safe place, where it is very easy to move around, and where you can buy almost everything you need once you arrive there.
But, located in the "high latitudes", just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to adapt to the heat (always) and to a strong sunlight (when the sky is clear, which is rarer).
There are also some buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Check that the bus you are considering taking will take you to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a great theme for holidays.
For example, visit castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or take a cruise along the Erie Canal.
They also define the routes for popular cycling trails and paths.
Christmas is one of the most important Christian festivals, it celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Many traditions associated with these festivals have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians in the world.
It is customary to spend Easter awake at a public place to watch the sunrise.
There are certainly Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be that it is a pre-Christian spring ritual.
Traditional churches often hold a vigil on Easter Sunday during the weekend of Easter, often breaking into the celebration at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All animals that have arrived on these islands have done so by water, by swimming or by air.
Because of the great distance between them and the continent, the mammoths could not go all the way, making the giant tortoise the main animal of pasture on the Galapagos.
From the arrival of man to the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including cattle, horses, cows, sheep, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the arctic or antarctic regions in winter, you will be able to see the polar night, during which the sun does not rise above the horizon.
It is a good opportunity to admire the northern lights, because the sky will be dark practically all day.
As regions are sparsely populated and that light pollution is not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than that which Westerners can be accustomed to.
The costumes are classic workwear, and employees are referred to by their family name or by their job title.
Work-life harmony is crucial, because it emphasises the collective effort rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers must often obtain the agreement of their superiors for any decision they take and are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without asking questions.
