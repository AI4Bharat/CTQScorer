When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from its main group (for example, when they move to a mountain or a river or a new island where they cannot return), they find themselves in a new environment.
These new environments are different sources and different competitors, so new generations need to be stronger competitors than they were before, and they need to have different capabilities or fit in order to succeed.
However, the fundamental population has not changed much, and they still need the same kind of adaptation.
Over time, they become more and more climate-friendly, and they become less and less visible.
Finally, after thousands or millions of years, two populations of the same species will be separated so that they are not considered as the same species.
We call this a distinctive process, which means only new species are created. Clarification is an inevitable result and evolution is a very significant part.
