It confirms not only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already very widespread, but provides details that the fossils cannot usually provide, such as colour and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this bird's feathers were brown-tan on the top and pale or carotenoïde on the bottom.
This discovery also allows us to better understand the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a fully developed root, but show other characteristics of feathers – beards and barbules – the researchers have concluded that the root was probably an evolutionary development later on.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight but rather for regulation or display of temperature. The researchers have suggested that even if this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not the feathers of a chick.
Scientists say that this is certainly a juvenile tail, but the sample reveals a feather belonging to an adult, not a juvenile.
A car bomb exploded at the headquarters of the police in Gaziantep, Turkey, this morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.

In the category of women sitting skiers, four skiers were unable to finish their race; in the slalom, 45 skiers on a total of 117 skiers were unable to place themselves in the top ten.
The police in Madhya Pradesh have recovered the laptop and mobile phone stolen.
The deputy inspector general D. K. Arya said: "We have arrested five people for having violated the Swiss citizen, and we have recovered her mobile phone and her laptop computer.
The accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the police commissioner, said that the people accused had their faces covered when they appeared before the court. 
While three people were present in the house when the car hit it, none were injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The road where the accident took place was temporarily closed to allow emergency services to extract the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was then taken to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son by the Sheriff Court of Edinburgh.
She is in custody awaiting trial and awaiting her trial, but eyewitness testimony could be compromised because her portrait has been very widely disseminated.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but the Scottish courts operate differently and courts have considered that publishing photos was potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, of Dundee University, notes that "journalists seem to follow a dangerous line if they publish photos, etc. of suspects.
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is responsible for all prosecutions, has said to journalists that no further comment will be made at least until the prosecution.
According to the leak, the document will deal with the dispute at the border that the Palestinians claim based on the existing borders before the Middle East War of 1967.
In addition to the other topics discussed are the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel requires a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of ten years from the signing of an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority only agrees to a five-year term.
The shooters of the additional test for the control of parasites had to be closely monitored by rangers, as the test was controlled and its effectiveness was being evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) inc., qualified volunteers were recruited, in the context of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, temporary conservation manager for the NPWS, the four shooters designated for the first abattoir campaign have been properly trained and instructed in safety procedures.
Martelly has just appointed a new provisional Electoral Council (CEP) consisting of nine members.
It is the fifth PEC of Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the dissolution of the previous CEP in the context of a set of measures aimed at engaging the country on the road to new elections.
This commission was the response of Martelly to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The demonstrations sometimes violent were triggered by the absence of elections, some of which were due to take place in 2011.
About 60 iPods overheating incidents have been reported, resulting in six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been informed of 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, the METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which it described as "non-serious.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded by saying that it was "really regrettable" that the report was postponed.
The earthquake struck the Mariannes at 7:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday)
The Emergency Management Office of the Northern Mariana Islands has declared that no damage has been reported in this country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has declared there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has taken hostages from Hong Kong tourists in Manila, the Philippines' capital.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Many hostages have been saved, and at least six of them have been confirmed to have died so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released prematurely, as well as the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the loo. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and decided to become a doctor.
He followed a training course in obstetrics, and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When he was working at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature births during his free time. 
His research has shown that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the pulmonary maturation of the baby.
Xinhua reported that the government investigators recovered two flight recorders (black boxes) on Wednesday.
Other boxers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: 'Luna was the first Queen of the extreme. My first manager. Luna died on two moons. A unique moment, like her. A strong woman.'
Dustin 'Goldust' Runnels commented that "Luna was as strange as me... or even more... I love her and she will be missed... I hope she rests in a better place.
A survey conducted among 1,400 people before the federal elections of 2010 revealed that the number of opponents to the transformation of Australia into a republic had increased by 8 % since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the federal election campaign that she thought Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 per cent of those surveyed share this view, and wish that Queen Elizabeth II is the last monarch to rule Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29% of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The gold medallist was due to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical condition was put under doubt.
He could not take the necessary medicines to overcome his pain, these being banned within the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the 25th January the largest known prime number.
Many people have checked the discovery using different equipment and software in February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Cosmic comets may have been a source of water for the earth, as well as organic matter that can form proteins and promote life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, and in particular how the Earth was formed, because comets have collided with it for a long time.
Cuomo, 53 years old, began his term as governor in January and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He has described the rumours as 'political babble and silly nonsense'.
We think he will be running for the Presidency in 2016.
According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that would enable aircraft to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
It is based on satellite technology, and not on ground-based radar systems used previously, which allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more detailed information.
The additional transport is non-existent and the surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and the parking and railway junctions are not available on the ground.
The fear of not having enough transport has led to the possibility that the match could be played in a closed stadium, without the fans of the teams.
A study published on Thursday in Science has revealed the origin of a new bird species in the Galápagos Islands equatorianas.
A Princeton University researcher and a University of Uppsala researcher have indicated that the new species had evolved in only two generations, although this process had been estimated much longer, due to reproductive interbreeding between a Darwin's finch endemic, Geospiza fortis, and the finch immigrant with conical beak, Geospiza conirostris.
You can shape gold in many ways. It can be rolled into small pieces.
It can be twisted and woven into fine threads. It can be hammered or laminated into sheets.
It can be made very fine, and glued onto another metal. It can be so fine that it has sometimes been used to decorate hand-painted images in manuscripts called 'enlumined manuscripts'.
That's what we call a chemical product pH. You can make a pH indicator by using red cabbage juice.
Le jus de chou changes of colour depending on the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the chemical tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electron (because hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron)." #
Mix the dry powders together, then, with clean hands and moist ones, press them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will produce an odd sensation and produce a sort of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets equipped with a flush in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage
Found remains of sewer systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman times, public toilets sometimes made up part of public baths where men and women could mingle.
When you call someone who is thousands of kilometres away, you use a satellite.
The satellite receives the call in space and then returns it to Earth almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts a part of our light and our vision.
A giant rocket is required to put a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in many ways. The greatest benefit it has brought us is to have made transport much simpler and faster.
It has brought us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Below are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, including rabbits, deer and other cattle.
In addition, there are many small cats (including free-roaming cats) that eat small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a special task assigned to each feline, preventing it from competing with other felines.
The lions are the most sociable cats, living in large groups called herds.
The packs are composed of one to three adult males, as well as a thirty-some females and cubs.
Women are generally very close to each other, their family being made up of a large number of sisters and daughters.
Lion troops act like packs of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other large cats) in their behaviour, and very deadly for their prey.
Balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (but sometimes very difficultly), swim, jump great distances and pull with five times the strength of a human powerful.
The tiger is part of the same family (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones capable of roaring.
The roar of the tiger does not resemble the roar of the lion, but rather to a phrase whose words would be cries and groans.
The ocelot is fond of small animals. It catches monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if it can. Almost all animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than him.
According to scientists, ocelots hunt and find prey (prey) by smelling their tracks on the ground.
They see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision, and they move also very furtively. The ocelots hunt their prey by blending into their environment before leaping on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it is derived (for example, if it moves above a mountain range or river, or if it moves to a new island so that it cannot easily return to the mainland), it often finds itself in a different environment than it was previously.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so that the new population will need new characteristics or adaptations to be a powerful competitor compared to what it had before.
The population of origin has not changed at all, it still needs the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they will no longer be considered to belong to the same species.
We call this process'speciation', which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, expire).
Plants produce their food by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The giant squid was the superpredator of the time, it did not fear anything, except other giant squid.
His long jaws were equipped with more than 70 sharp teeth, as well as a series of additional teeth in the palate, so that anything that crossed his path could not escape.
We are not sure, but it may have been a bit tongue-tied. His diet included large fish, other plesiosaurs, and it may even have been cannibalistic.
He also attacked everything that was in water, even a dinosaur of such size as a T. rex was not up to the task against him.
While the Romans ate food that we know, they ate strange or unusual dishes, including deer, pigeons, snails and slugs, as well as the hare, a sort of rodent.
Another difference: while the poor and the woman ate their food sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to organise banquets where they rested on the side while they ate.
Roman meals of the ancient world could not include these foods that have been introduced into Europe centuries later. 
For example, they did not have wheat, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Romans have ever tasted pork.
Babylonians built for each of their gods a main temple which was regarded as the dwelling of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had a courtyard, then a inner sanctum, which only the priests could enter.
Some of the pyramids, the ziggurats, were sometimes built as part of a temple." #
The summit of the tower was a special temple for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
The bulk of the family's Jewish life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the court; shops were only open counters giving on the street. Houses were built of stones. 
As there were no large forests in Canaan, the wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In Scandinavian sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder he found Greenland and named it after him.
But regardless of its discovery, the Eskimo people lived there already in the past.
While each country is'scandinavian', there are many differences between the people, the kings, the customs and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the film Benjamin Gates and the Templar Treasure, you may think that a treasure map has been drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that is not true. Although there is a stamp on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, it read: 'Original Declaration of Independence dated 4 July 1776.' The text is on the reverse.
While no one really knows who wrote it, we know that at an early stage of its existence, the great scroll (which measures approximately 29 inches three quarters on 24 inches) was rolled up.
It is therefore highly likely that the rating was added simply as an identifier.
The day of the landing and the subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
She was ruled by French Vichy, French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupying power instead of facing it.
On August 15, 1940, Allied forces landed in the south of France, Operation "Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French Forces had liberated the south of France and were heading for Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large number of people who live and work in cooperation, a society.
The word 'civilisation' derives from the Latin word 'civis', which means 'citizen' and is related to the Latin words 'civitas', which means 'city' or'state' and which also indicates, in some way, the size of the society to which it relates.
Cities-states are the pioneers of nations. A civilisational culture involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a durable cultural empreinte and an equitable distribution.
Minority cultures are often disappearing without leaving any historically relevant traces and are not recognized as genuine civilisations.
In the revolutionary war, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government — the Congress being its only component — under the Articles of the Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes and, as there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on the authorities of the state, often less cooperative, to enforce all its acts.
He did not have the power to derogate from tax laws or from customs laws between states.
The articles required unanimous consent of all the States before they could be amended and States took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, with Germany's national team, the second most successful team in the world and it has won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
In popular sports, football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, equestrian sports, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 are included.
Skiing is the most popular sport in the northern regions, Italians participating in international and Olympic events.
Japan has more than 7 000 islands (the largest being Honshu), which makes it the seventh-largest island in the world!
Because of its group of islands, Japan is often referred to, geographically, as an 'archipelago'.
The first information about Taiwan comes from the fifteenth century, while European sailors passing through it made mention of it as Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the south-west of Taiwan, introducing a transformation of traditional Taiwanese rice and sugarcane production practices, and employing Chinese workers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared them province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat during the first Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Treaty, by which it ceded Taiwan to Japan, which was then ruling the island until 1945.
The Inca citadel is made up of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the sun temple and the three windows.
Most of the buildings adjacent to the complex have been rebuilt to provide better views of their original appearance.
In 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored and this restoration continues to the present day.
For example, the most common format of photographic film is 35 mm; it was the most common format of film used at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still made today, but what is important is that its image format is inherited from the format of the digital camera's sensor.
The 35 mm format is actually 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
So we say that the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by 12 to obtain the simplest of integer ratios) is 3:2.
Many common formats (APS family, for example) are equal to this aspect ratio or are close to it.
The third-country rule, which has been so badly mistreated and often ridiculed, is a simple directive which offers dynamism while at the same time providing protection.
He points out that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the vertical and horizontal lines dividing the image (see example).
In this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was being questioned.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has bound the European Union together despite the differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power touched everyone, from the king to the peasants.
One of the most important Christian principles is that wealth should be used to relieve suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds are there specifically for this reason.
The central church authority was in Rome for more than 1000 years and this concentration of power and money has led many people to ask whether this doctrine was respected.
After the outbreak of hostilities, Britain established a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategy has proven effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade has been flagrantly violating international law generally accepted and codified by several international agreements of the two last centuries.
The UK is mining international waters to prevent ships from venturing into entire areas of maritime space, thereby constituting a threat even for neutral ships.
As this tactic has not elicited a timid reaction, Germany expected a similar reaction to its underwater warfare without limits.
In the 20th century, most citizens and nations showed a preference for pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of the War during the First World War, nations wished to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four hundred dollars in his name, a poetry book and a recommendation letter from Charles Batchelor (his previous employer) to Thomas Edison.
The ancient Chinese had a unique way of showing the different periods of China or each family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
There were also periods of instability between dynasties. The most famous of these periods is the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty.
In these periods, fierce battles have taken place between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms were one of the bloodiest periods in Chinese history. Thousands of people have died in battle to sit on the throne of the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political repercussions such as the use of the metric system, the passage from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people and not to one single leader.
As well, after the Revolution, the professions were opened to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and the most talented to succeed.
It goes without saying that the army is no longer based on class, but on calibre.
The French Revolution has also inspired many other oppressed working-classes in other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions that transcended the worldly life. He was accustomed to frequenting a cave which has become famous under the name of 'Hira' on the mountain of 'Noor' (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
située at the top of one of the mountains in Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy at all to find, even if we know that it exists. When we entered the cave, we were completely isolated.
Up there, you can only look at the clear sky and the many mountains surrounding it. From the inside of the cave, you can only see or hear very little of this universe.
The Great Pyramid of Gizeh is the only of the Seven Wonders that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians during the third millennium BC, and is one of many gigantic structures erected in honour of the Pharaohs who died.
The Giza plateau, or 'Giza necropolis', in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, contains several pyramids (the largest being the most imposing), several small tombs, many temples and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built to honour the Pharaoh Kheops, and many small pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honour his wives as well as his family.
The symbol 'push' looks like a V and the symbol 'pull' looks like a staple or a square with a missing bottom.
The top means you must start with the tip and push the bow, and the bottom means you must start with the arrow and pull the bow.
A bow produces a more pleasant sound when it is aimed upwards, while a bow aimed downwards produces a more forceful sound.
Don't forget to write your own names on the pencil, but don't forget that the musical pencils are printed for a musical reason, and that you should therefore generally respect them.
On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, his wife Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old), and the sister of the king, Madame Elisabeth, all terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by
In a carriage, they went back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and screamed threats against the king and the queen.
The king and the queen were forced to open their carriages because of the crowd.
At a certain point, a crowd member brandished the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles before the terrified queen.
The American imperialist war expenditures in the Philippines have been paid by the people of the Philippines themselves.
They were forced to pay colonial US taxes to cover a large part of the expenses and interest of the US-issued bonds issued by the US-owned banks in the Philippines.
Of course, the superprofits derived from prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people could be the fundamental benefits of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you must understand the context that led to their creation.
These events took place during the period generally considered to be the High Middle Ages – a period of European history from 1000 to 1300.
The Middle Ages Central preceded the High Middle Ages and followed by the Low Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from the technological push or the imperative to a strict sense in which the destiny of humanity is determined by a logical underpinning linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies.
Many interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: technological development itself is a process that transcends cultural and political influences, and technology has an impact on societies that are intrinsically conditioned rather than socially.
For example, one could say that the car is a necessary condition for road development.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a few cars, so new methods of production are developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Massive ownership of cars also leads to an increased incidence of road accidents, which leads to the development of new techniques in the field of health care for treating body injuries.
Romanticism presented an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
According to Romantic theories, geography would have shaped individuals and, over time, customs and a culture associated with this geography would have emerged. These, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris is known as the capital of the contemporary world of fashion, Constantinople was regarded as the capital of the medieval Europe.
His reputation as the centre of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until 1100 AD.
His status has declined over the twelfth century, mainly because the Crusaders returned with presents such as silk and spices, which the Byzantine markets could not compete with.
It was during this period that the title of the capital of fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic architecture reached its peak between the 10th and 13th centuries.
At the beginning, the dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture, to the east.
However, due to the slowness of communication means, Western modes could be behind by 25 to 30 years.
In the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time, following the crusades, was the use of buttons for closing clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is a form of agriculture practised to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, often organic, using locally-sourced seeds, combined with rotational or other simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers practised subsistence agriculture and that is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures gather individuals feeling neglected by social norms and sharing the same ideas which enables them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnic origin, class, location and / or sex of members.
The criteria that determine a subculture as distinctive can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
A subculture often signals its membership by distinctive and symbolic use of style, which encompasses modes, maniérismes, and slang.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialisation is to draw on a few unfortunate cases of children who, by neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse, have not been socialised by adults during their childhood.
Those children are considered to be 'wild' or 'wild'. Some children who were left by their parents were locked up by people (usually their own parents) ; in some cases, the abandonment of this child was due to the rejection by parents of a severe intellectual or physical disability which the child suffered.
Wild children may have suffered serious abuse or trauma before being abandoned or escaping.
Others would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in the wild.
When raised by non-human species, wild children display behaviours (in the limits of their physical capacities) almost identical to those of the species that raised them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the support goes further.
Support is not a method of learning but rather a means of helping learners who discover a new teaching such as the use of a new programme or the start of a new project.
Supports can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but the little Microsoft Office guy is also one.
Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are intended to guide, explain and guide students through procedures that could have been too difficult to manage by the student alone.
Children are placed in foster care for very diverse reasons which include neglect, extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, attentive and educational, but that is the case.
We perceive family placement as a secure area for these children.
Our family placement system is supposed to provide safe, loving homes, stable carers, stable education and reliable healthcare.
The placement in family homes is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were previously removed.
Internet combines mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approach to usages and gratifications.
For example, 'learning' and'socialisation' are seen as major factors promoting Internet use (James et al., 1995).
« Personal involvement » and « ongoing relationships » have also been identified as being new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied the public reaction to Internet sites.
Video recording has led to great discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, that is, facial expressions during a few milliseconds.
They claim that one can detect if a person is lying by interpreting correctly micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, has said how people with cerebral lesions are able to assess the sincerity of the speech accurately.
He suggests that such human-animal interpretation abilities may be found in domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two genetic reservoirs: hidden and expressed.
A mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the reserve of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination alternate between the two basins at each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a non-human primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet his or her amino acid needs from the available plant resources.
In addition, a lack of reaction has serious consequences: growth disturbances, malnutrition and ultimately, death.
The most easily accessible resources would be the plant proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult to digest for us, unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal-based foodstuffs (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest and provide a large amount of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
In all fairness, we should not be surprised if our own forefathers have solved their 'protein problem' in a similar way as chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep deprivation is the process of intentional wakefulness during your sleep and subsequently, for a period of 10 to 60 minutes, unconsciousness.
It can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock, so that you wake up without waking up completely.
If you find yourself resetting your clock during your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other possibilities based on the biorhythm include drinking a lot of liquids before going to bed (for example, water or tea, reputed to be diuretics), which forces you to wake up to urinate.
The degree of peace within a person opposes to the degree of tension in his or her body and mind.
When the tension is low, the vital force present is positive. Each person has the possibility to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been enriched by the path of mahayana love and by many Indian techniques of yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (illumination energy) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
Tibetan Buddhist meditation centres are the yoga of the deity. It is through visualising different deities that the channels of energy are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of awakening is created.
Germany was a common enemy during the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, deep conflicts between their different systems, methods and cultures led to the end of the entente between these two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the old allies have become enemies and the cold war has begun.
It would last for the next 40 years and see real conflicts, through proxy armies, on battlefields in Africa as well as Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defence was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganise along the Romanian front.
But these plans have become obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800 000 Soviet troops arrived and created the Bieloruss-Ukrainian front after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, as well as other international treaties, bilateral or multilateral, that they be bilateral or multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient means of transporting large quantities of people and goods through oceans.
The work of the armed forces has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the capacity to move your people and your goods, while interfering with your enemy's capacity to move its people and its goods.
One of the most recent examples of this situation has been the North Atlantic campaign during the Second World War. The Americans were trying to cross the Atlantic Ocean to help the British.
At the same time, the German Navy, using mainly U-Boats, tried to stop this trade.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Great Britain as it has done for the rest of Europe.
It seems that the goats were domesticated for the first time some 10 000 years ago in the Zagros mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribal groups began to keep them close to them so that they could easily access milk, fur, skins and meat.
Domestic sheep were usually kept in herds that wandered on the hills or other pasture areas, often cared for by shepherds who were most often children or adolescents, known as'sheep-breeders'. These pastoral methods have always existed today.
The 'wagonways' were built in England from the fifteenth century.
While the wagons were simply made of parallel planks, they allowed horses to reach greater speeds and to carry heavier loads than on the slightly more accident-prone roads of the day.
The cross-ties were introduced early enough to keep the runways in place. However, it was soon apparent that the runways would be more effective if they were provided with a steel plate on the top.
It has become a common practice, but iron has caused more wear on the wooden wheels of wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails were introduced.
The first means of locomotion was walking: humans began walking upright about two million years ago with the arrival of the Homo Erectus ("right-handed man").
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, walked on all fours.
There are bipedal specializations in fossils of Australopithecus afarensis from 4,2 to 3,9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs already seven million years ago.
We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even fight to reduce the suffering to come.
In many cases, it is a symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not just want a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems and disable them.
There is no doubt that the world has changed greatly thanks to the scientific and technological achievements of mankind, and that the problems have become more serious because of the overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of mankind.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a draft manuscript signed by the Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to a few blocks away, to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
In the night between 150 and 200 copies were made, known as "Dunlap Broadsides.
The first reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the Independence Hall court on 8 July.
One of them was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who read it to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy reached London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap leaves that we know of still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript has not survived.
Many palaeontologists now believe that a dinosaur group survived and is still alive. They are called birds.
Many people regard them as dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly.
But there are still a lot of birds that look like a dinosaur.
They have scales on their feet and claws, they lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on information manipulation that is coded in binary form.
A binary number can only have one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary numbers, or bits for using the computer jargon.
An internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are sufficiently general to allow a diagnosis to be made without immediate certainty.
The best indicator of an internal poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of toxic household chemicals or medicines.
Look at the label to find out the first-aid instructions specific to this poison.
The term 'insect' is used by entomologists in a formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
This term derives from an old familiarity with bed bugs, which are very adapted to parasitizing humans.
Snakes, like bed bugs, are nidicolous, that is to say, they are adapted to live in the nest or the host's home.
In the United States, there are approximately 400 000 known cases of MS, making it the principal neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a central nervous system disease that affects the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have MS than men.
A couple can very well feel that it is not in their interest, nor in the child's interest, to take care of the child's education.
These couples can choose to make a baby adoption plan.
In adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main objective of science is to understand how the world works by means of scientific method. This method guides in fact most scientific research.
But it is not the only, the experimentation, and an experiment is a test that serves to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, pose questions and make observations, but which also orients the scientific research.
Naturalist and philosophers have focused on ancient texts, and in particular on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's opinions on all scientific questions, including psychology, were accepted.
With the decline of Greek knowledge, Western civilization has been cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behaviour depend, in large part, on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which do not simply represent periodic responses to external stimuli, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to operate for a certain period even without external stimulation.
The experiment Hershey and Chase was one of the main indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacteria.
They have carried out two experiments to mark the phage DNA with a radioactive phosphorus or with a radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the extent of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only germline mutations can be passed on to children, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism is aimed at people who want to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, including wildlife and flora.
Hunting, fishing, bird watching, visiting parks and studying the information on the ecosystem are examples of activities on the spot.
You can, for example, go to see, photograph and discover orang-utans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave the countryside towns in cars to get to their place of work and cross other people who are going to work in the country they have just left.
In this dynamic passenger transport system, everyone is in some way connected to a vehicle-based transport system based on private cars and supports it.
The science now shows that this massively carbon-based economy has pushed the biosphere out of its stable state that has supported human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about water quality or bridge collapses.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they break down every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movements of drivers and vehicles between two points, and the interactions they exert between themselves.
It is unfortunately difficult to study the flow of traffic, because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with 100 % certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act in a reasonable range; so, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically approximatively.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) the flow, (2) the density and (3) the speed.
These relations help to plan, design and operate road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly enabled them to escape more easily from their enemies and to find more effectively food and companions.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their bodies.
It gives them more hiding places.
Today, only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and ephemerals.
There are some thousands of years ago, a man called Aristotle asserted that the solar system moved around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system moved around the earth, including the sun (and even the other stars).
It seems reasonable, because the Earth does not feel like it is moving, is that not?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times the volume of water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the world's largest river, reaching up to 10 km wide.
About 20% of the water that falls from rivers on the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main branch of the Amazon River is 6 387 km (3 980 miles). It collects the water of thousands of small rivers.
While the construction of pyramids in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Great Pyramid of Giza has never been surpassed in size and the technical excellence of its construction.
Ancient Egyptians were enchanted by the monuments of their predecessors, who had then been in existence for more than a thousand years.
Vatican City has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and the least populated.
The Vatican City State drafts its legislation and official communications in Italian.
Italian is also the language of everyday use by most of the people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
The citizens of the Vatican City are all Catholic.
From antiquity, people have been familiar with basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, because they are found in nature in their pure form and are relatively simple to mine using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, has theorised that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. It was earth, water, air and fire.
It was more about the four states of matter (in the same order) : solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although he also made the assertion that these latter would transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are primarily a mixture of two metals or more. Remember that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered as metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys which contain a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of minuscule particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that billions of them could enter into this period at the end of this sentence.
So, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it was released.
Unfortunately, the appearance of new modes of writing has relegated the pen to a more private status and has become more rare.
People now write messages on computers, without ever having to approach a pencil.
It is only natural to wonder what the keyboard will become when the next new thing comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it transforms energy by combining a nucleus of a myriad of protons and neutrons.
Like if you were to make a hill climb by a heavy cart. Dividing the core again, then letting some of this energy out.
Some atoms have a highly unstable nucleus, so they tend to break up with little or no pressure.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust. Its outer layer is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the visible side and 100 km on the hidden side.
It is finer at sea level and thicker below the continents.
There may be more lava on the side close to the crater because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are concerned with the search for what makes people feel good or attracted.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they matured into adulthood.
These theories examine what prompts some people to want what they do and what, in their environment, prompts them to do or not do what they do.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and the two-factor theory of Herzberg.
Generally speaking, two behaviours can emerge when a manager becomes the boss of former colleagues. One extreme is to try to stay 'the good friend' (or 'the good friend's') and the other is to try
A manager of this type is not able to take unpopular decisions, carry out disciplinary actions, carry out evaluations, delegate responsibilities, and hold others responsible.
On the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an individual who is unrecognizable and feels that he/she must change everything that the group has created up to now and do things his/her way.
After all, the boss is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behaviour often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same high standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical team.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet at different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a real 'invisible' team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also an unique element of a virtual team.
The 'invisible' team is the team of management which each member reports to. It sets the standards for each of them.
Why would an organisation want to create a structure for learning? One of the objectives related to the implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all the resources available are effectively used in functional services of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can be expressed fully.
Thus, a process of working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
Before an organisation can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and its own culture of learning.
Angel (2006) describes Continuum as a method used to help organisations achieve better results.
Neurobiological data provide material evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. They allow therefore to reduce the research field and make it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of damage, lesions, tumours and brain trauma affect behaviour and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
It gives us a lot of information and material to build models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence is often strongly connoted with science-fiction, it represents a very important part of computer science that studies the behaviour, learning and adapting intelligently of a machine.
Artificial intelligence research is concerned with the automating of tasks requiring an intelligent approach.
The examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to customer diagnostics and questions, as well as recognition of writing, voice and facial features.
This practice has led to distinct disciplines, aimed at providing solutions to the day-to-day problems of life.
The system of artificial intelligence is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and military, as it was put into practice in several home computer software and video games.
Excursions are integral to any school class. Often, a teacher would like to take his students to places where a bus journey is not possible.
The solution is provided by technology in the form of virtual educational excursions. Students can watch ancient objects from a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a beautiful work of art while sitting in their class.
Participating practically to a trip is also a good way of reflecting on a trip and sharing your experiences with future generations.
For example, students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design and produce a website each year dedicated to their visit to the capital of the state. Each year, the website is updated, but the old versions are kept online for use as an album.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Even if students often try blogging with poor grammar and spelling, having a public audience makes it easier to improve.
As students are often the most critical audience, the author of the blog is trying to improve his writing in order to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging "forces students to better understand the world around them". The need to stimulate public interest encourages students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are an effective tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning well beyond the traditional school day.
When used well, blogs can enable students to strengthen their analytical and critical thinking skills: by reacting actively to online content, they can confront their own opinion with that of others and expose their own views on specific topics.
Ottawa is the charming capital bilingual of Canada and has a large number of art galleries and museums that highlight the past and present of Canada.
You will find further south the falls of Niagara and further north, the Muskoka region and its environs which possess a virgin natural beauty.
All these measures, and many more, make Ontario what foreigners regard as the quintessence of Canada.
A large part of the northern regions are sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited in the wild.
For a comparison of the population that is more than a little surprising: There are more African-Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean, close to the African coast.
Madagaskar is by far the largest country, and even a continent by itself, in terms of wildlife.
Most of the small islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known for being luxury beach resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam into the land and this religion has spread widely to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the fifteenth century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route which connects Europe to India.
North, the region is defined by the Sahara Desert, and south and east by the Atlantic Ocean.
To women: It is recommended that any woman who travels say that she is married, regardless of her civil status.
It is also advisable to wear a wedding ring (which should not seem too precious).
Women must realise that some cultural differences may lead to behaviours that they consider as harassment. It is indeed common that they are followed, caught by the arm, etc.
Be firm in your refusal of advances, and don't be afraid to hold your ground (cultural differences or not, it does not mean that it is acceptable!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Ptolemies, the Romans and the Merovingians as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese, who after it had been destroyed it had rebuilt and named it Casa Branca, finally abandoned it in 1755 after a quake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city under the name of Daru l-Badya, and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in all of Morocco for shopping.
Around the old medina, you can easily find places where you can buy traditional Moroccan products, such as tajines, pottery, leather goods, and all sorts of jewellery, but it is all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located in the extreme east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano which buried most of the city's streets, in particular the city centre.
Goma is reasonably secure, but any visit to the outside of Goma should be subject to investigation to understand the state of the fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of Nyiragongo volcano as well as for gorilla tracking treks among the least expensive in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motor taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) fare is about 500 CDF for a short trip.
Combined with its relative remoteness, "Tombouctou" has become a metaphor for distant and exotic countries.
Today, Tombouctou is a poor city, although its reputation as a tourist attraction makes it a popular destination, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the World Heritage List as a site at risk of desertification.
It was one of the main steps in the "Wonders of the African World" episode of Henry Louis Gates on PBS.
The city contrasts markedly with the rest of the country, because it has a style more Arab than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is situated in the north-east of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the border with the Crocodile River south.
The total area of the park is 19 500 km2, which is divided into 14 ecozones, each of which contains a specific fauna.
This is one of the most famous South African National Parks and regarded as the jewel in the SANParks' crown.
As for all South African national parks, there are daily entry and conservation fees.
It may be advantageous to purchase a Wild Card which gives access to some South African national parks, as well as all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the name of the territory of Hong Kong and represents the main centre of interest for many tourists.
The row of skyscrapers that forms the horizon of Hong Kong was compared to a glittering bar chart, which is revealed by reflection in the Victoria harbour.
To admire the most beautiful panoramas of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to Kowloon's seafront located opposite.
The majority of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the northern side of the harbour.
This is the place that the British colonists have invested. Thus, it seems to be a good starting point, if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this region.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest mangrove forest belt, extending for 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the back-country of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans were declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of the forest located on Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are, however, not only made up of mangrove swamps: they also contain some of the last vestiges of the majestic jungles that covered the Ganges plain once.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3 850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water/wetlands.
Sundarbans is a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, you will find there about 400 Bengal tigers and 30 000 striped hyenas.
Buses leave the inter-city bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, but most, especially those that serve the east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6 and 7 a.m.
Inter-district buses are often full, so it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese ferries, which are comfortable and robust.
The collective taxis are a quick and comfortable way to get to places close by, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock Bridge is a suspension bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to link the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint George's-de-l'Oyapock
The two towers stand at a height of 83 metres; it is 378 metres long and has two 3,50 m wide tracks.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. The structure was completed in August 2011, but it was opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge should be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs posts should be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group living in what is now the eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also practising subsistence agriculture.
Other tribes of indigenous peoples who populated the Chaco, such as the Guaycurú or the Payaguá, survived mainly by fishing, hunting or gathering.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, once called 'the giant province of India', was born of the meeting between Spanish conquerors and indigenous peoples.
The Spanish inaugurated the period of colonization, which lasted three centuries.
From the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain a large part of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best teams and among the best polo players in the world.
The biggest polo tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
In addition, smaller tournaments and matches are sometimes held here at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, see the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Isle of Man is the Manx pound (FKP), which is equivalent to a pound sterling (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the sole bank in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
The pound sterling is a widely accepted currency in the islands, while in Stanley, credit cards and American dollars are also often accepted.
On the nearby islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, even if it is possible that British and American dollars will be accepted. Talk to the owners in advance about a payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange money from the Maldives outside the islands, so exchange it before you leave the islands.
Montevideo being located south of the equator, winter in the northern hemisphere corresponds to summer there and vice-versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical zone and summer temperatures can exceed 30 °C.
Winter can be misleadingly cold: temperatures rarely fall below zero, but wind and humidity combine to give the impression that it is colder than what the thermometer says.
There are no 'rainy' and 'dry' seasons: rainfall is pretty constant all year round.
Although many of the animals at the park are accustomed to seeing humans, they are still wild animals; please do not feed them or disturb them.
According to the park authorities, you must stay at least 100 meters from wolves and bears and at least 25 meters from all other wild animals!
As they may seem to be so docile, the bison, the elk, the moose, the bear and almost all the great animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they did not keep a sufficient distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them some space.
In addition, know that odours attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking odours-rich foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of about 40 000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and is the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a tragic naval standoff in 1889, when seven German, American and British ships refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
The Supreme Head Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was assassinated during a peaceful gathering in the city, during the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement.
The beaches are numerous, because Auckland is on the border of two ports. The most popular ones are in three zones.
The North Shore beaches are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay north to Devonport south.
Almost all beaches are sandy and allow safe swimming, and most are shaded by Pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the chic Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in the centre of Auckland.
The beaches, often very frequented by families, have many shops along the coast. Swimming is safe.
The local beer is the 'Number One', a rather ordinary beer, but tasty and refreshing. There is also another local beer, the 'Manta'.
There are many French wines to taste, but New Zealand and Australia wines may travel better.
You can drink the tap water locally without any risk, but you can easily find bottled water if you have concerns about it.
For Australians, the idea of a 'coffee cream' is foreign. A black short is an 'espresso', the cappuccino is filled with cream (not foam) and the tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is Belgian standard. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries due to one of these causes on the reef are rare.
However, follow the advice of authorities, obey all signs and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
From October to April, north of 1770, the box jellyfish arrive near beaches and river estuaries. They can also sometimes be seen outside this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most of them are afraid of humans and would run away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their main habitat is in estuary rivers in north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveller the peace of mind that he will have somewhere to sleep once he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have special agreements with specific hotels, but you can also book accommodation through travel agencies of other types of accommodation, such as camping sites.
Travel agencies usually offer packages including breakfast, transport from/to the airport or even packages combining flight and accommodation.
They can also retain your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or to procure other documents necessary for your destination (for example, a visa).
Any modification or request should, however, be addressed to the travel agency first and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants decide to camp on site, and most consider that this is an integral part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the music event, you will have to arrive early to find a well-placed camping site.
Don't forget that even if the music concerts are over on the main stages, other music concerts can continue until late at night on other sites of the festival.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the Baltic in winter, be sure to check the location of the hut, as the crossing of the ice can cause unbearable noise at the most exposed huts.
Cruises to St Petersburg include time spent in the city. Passengers on cruise ships are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos generally make a lot of efforts to maximise the time and money spent by their customers. There are rarely windows and clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer special offers of food, beverages and entertainment to keep the guests happy and to keep them at the party.
On some sites, it is the premises that offer free alcoholic beverages. However, drunkenness impairs judgement, and all good players should know that it is crucial to remain sober.
Anyone who travels to high latitudes or crosses mountains must consider the possibility of snow, ice or cold temperatures.
On icy roads and icy conditions, friction is low and you cannot drive like you are on tarmac.
While snowstorms are raging, it can fall in very little time enough snow to block you.
Visibility can also be limited by snow or sleet or by condensation or ice on the windows of vehicles.
On the other hand, there is normal snow and ice cover in many countries, and traffic is practically continuous all year round.
Safaris are perhaps the most popular tourist attraction in Africa and the most memorable moment for many visitors.
In everyday parlance, the term'safari' refers to an African excursion, and in particular to a wildlife safari, which is intended to witness the spectacular spectacle of wildlife in their natural habitat.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach close to cars and standard equipment allows them to be observed.
Lion, cheetah and leopards are sometimes timid and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as 'walking safari', 'pedestrian safari' or 'footing') consists of walking, either for a few hours, or for several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will take place in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympic Games, after hosting the Games in 1964.
If you have booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you will be in a difficult position.
The policies of cancellation vary, but from mid-March most cancellation policies based on the coronavirus do not extend to July 2020, the date on which the Olympic Games had been planned.
We expect that most events tickets will cost between 2 500 and 130 000 yens, typical tickets costing around 7 000 yens.
When ironing wet clothes, it is easier to iron them. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards which can be borrowed, even if there is no iron in the room. 
If you do not have a iron or do not want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if you find one.
Avoid leaving the fabric too hot (which can cause its shrinkage or in extreme cases, to burn it).
There are different ways of purifying water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it is enough to boil the water for a minute; in others, it is necessary to boil it for several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you have a problem, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers can encounter dangerous animals they do not know in their home region.
Parasites can contaminate food, cause irritations or, in the most serious cases, cause allergic reactions, spread venom or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals which can wound or kill people by force, are not usually considered to be parasites.
In some areas, duty free shops present an opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and customs duties.
Travellers to destinations where taxes are high can sometimes make substantial savings, in particular on alcoholic beverages or tobacco.
The most difficult section of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway passes through isolated backcountry areas of the hinterland.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your eyes open: steep gradients, narrow roads and tight bends predominate.
Speed limits displayed are significantly lower than in previous sections and following – usually between 35 and 40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and strict compliance is still more important than before.
On the other hand, mobile telephony is surprisingly much stronger here than on many other parts of the road, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cakes are rather good, and in Bavaria, they are very rich and varied, very similar to those of their southern neighbour, Austria.
Fruit cakes are a common feature of the dessert menu: apples are baked and baked in cakes all year round, while pears and plums are in season in summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, walnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes often go well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but tasty Berliners, try the Berliners, also called Berliners, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen according to regions.
A curry is a dish made up of herbs and spices, accompanied by meat or vegetables.
A curry dish can be'solid' or 'liquid', depending on the amount of sauce it contains.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in the south of India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesia having 17 000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines present in all of the country.
However, when this term is used without any other qualifying term, it tends to refer to foods originating from the central and eastern island of Java.
Now, widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a wide range of simple dishes, the predominant tastes being the cacao nuts, peppers, sugar (especially the coconut sugar of Java) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are foot rests for the rider, which hang from each side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability to the user, but they can pose a security problem: for example, the user's feet can get stuck in the footrest.
If a horseman is thrown from a horse, but has a leg caught in the stirrup, he could be dragged if the horse escapes. To minimise this risk, a number of measures of security can be taken.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a flat sole and a narrow heel.
In addition, some saddles, in particular English saddles, have safety bars which allow a rider to fall off the saddle if he is pulled back by a rider who falls.
Valley of Cochamó – The excellence destination for climbing in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with many different granite peaks and cliffs.
From the summits, the panoramas are spectacular. The alpinists around the world are discovering new routes practicable on the slopes, where the possibilities are endless. 
Skiing and snowboarding are popular sports that involve sliding down a snowy slope with skis or snowboards attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity that has many fans, sometimes called'ski bums', who organise their entire holidays around skiing in specific places.
The idea of skiing is very ancient: some prehistoric paintings show skiers for some time.
Let us remember that, when Galileo declared in the 17th century that the earth revolved around the sun, he was threatened with torture by the Catholic Church for daring to contradict the accepted fact that the earth was at the centre of the universe.
Skiing: this activity is also called Nordic skiing, cross-country skiing or hiking. 
It resembles alpine skiing, as well as alpine climbing, but does not include these activities, which are practiced on rocky terrain and require the use of skis and boots much stiffer than those used for skiing.
Think of skiing as a similar hiking route.
In good conditions, you can walk a little further than you can run – but you will never reach the speeds of skiing without a heavy pack on a muddy track.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but containing many independent countries. In normal circumstances, travelling through several countries involves several visa applications and several passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, operates a little like one country in this regard.
As long as you remain within this area, you can usually cross borders without having to go through passport controls.
In addition, having a Schengen visa means you do not need to apply separately for each of the Member States of the area, which allows you to save time, money and administrative procedures.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique. Some tax authorities define antiquities as objects over 100 years old.
The age of consent varies according to where one is located; in some parts of the world, such as in North America, the age limit can be lower than that in force in Europe.
Artisanal products can be considered as antiquities even if they are less ancient than similar industrial products.
Reindeer herding is a major means of subsistence for Samis and the culture surrounding this trade has a great importance for many other professions.
Although, according to tradition, all Samis have not been involved in large-scale reindeer herding, they lived mainly from fishing, hunting and other similar activities, using reindeer mainly as livestock.
Today, many Samis practice modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Lapland, the Sami region.
While widely used, in particular among non-Romas, the term 'Gitan' is often considered to be pejorative because of its association with negative stereotypes and an unfair image of the Roma people.
If the country you are travelling to is subject to a travel warning issued by your government, your overseas health insurance or travel insurance may be affected.
You can also consult other governments that yours, but their advice is tailored to their citizens.
As an example, US citizens in the Middle East might be faced with different situations from those faced by Europeans or Arabs.
The opinions are only a brief summary of the political situation of a country.
The opinions presented are often superficial, general and too simplified in comparison to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Violent weather is the generic term for any dangerous meteorological phenomenon that may cause damage, social disruption or loss of life.
Very adverse weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and they can be of several kinds, depending on the geographical, topographical and atmospheric characteristics.
Violent winds, heavy rain, excessive precipitation and fires are forms and effects of violent weather, just as thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes and cyclones.
Extreme weather phenomena, regional and seasonal, include cold winter storms, snowstorms with violent winds, and sandstorms or dust storms.
It is strongly recommended that travellers check the weather in their destination region, knowing that it may have an impact on their travel plans.
Anyone considering a trip to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive a vocational training.
A search on the Internet for "Cours in hostile environment" will probably lead to a local business.
A course will cover most of the issues raised here in much more detail, usually with a practical experience.
A training course normally lasts for 2 to 5 days and includes role playing, lots of first aid, and sometimes a training in the use of weapons.
Wild survival books are commonplace, but war-zone survival books are rare.
Passengers planning to undergo a gender reassignment abroad should ensure that they have valid documents for their return journey.
The governments' desire to issue passports with the gender of the applicant (X) or to update documents to correspond to the applicant's name and sex wishes varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honour these documents is also variable.
Security checkpoint searches have become much more intrusive in the era of post-11 September 2001.
Transgender people in the pre-op phase should not be expected to pass the body scanners in order to preserve their privacy and dignity.
Storm surges are the surges that return from breaking waves, often on a reef or equivalent.
Because of the underwater topography, the return flow is concentrated on a few deeper sections, and a fast flow to the deep can form.
In most cases, deaths are due to exhaustion which results from trying to swim against the tide, which can be impossible.
When you leave the current, swimming back is not more difficult than usual.
You may also want to aim for a place where you will not be taken again. It is possible that, depending on your skills and whether you have been spotted or not, you may want to wait for help.
The shock of reintegration occurs earlier than the cultural shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer and is more severe.
Travelers who have had a hard time adjusting to the new culture have sometimes a lot of trouble adjusting to their home culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and have lost some of your old habits.
At first, when you travelled abroad, people were probably patients and understanding, knowing that travellers in a new country must adapt.
People may not be anticipating that patience and understanding are also necessary for travellers and travellers returning home.
The light and sound show at the Pyramid is one of the most interesting attractions in the region for children.
You can see the pyramids in the darkness and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
Often, we hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The history of sound and light is like a history book.
The Sphinx is placed as the backdrop and the narrator of a long history.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and the different pyramids are lit.
Shetland Islands are claimed by several nations and have the largest number of research stations and 16 of them are active in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the peninsula. The island of King George, with the village of Villa Las Estrellas, is the largest.
Other examples: Livingston Island and the disappointment, where the inland caldera of an active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbour.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, then reappear to form the Ellsworth Range, which runs for 360 km and passes through the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern chain, or Sentinel Range, contains the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which stands at 4892 m.
In remote areas without cellular network, you may not have any other choice than to use satellite telephony.
A satellite phone does not replace a mobile phone, because you need to be outside and have a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
It is a service often used by navigation, including pleasure craft, as well as by expeditions that require data transmission at a distance and telephony.
Your local telecommunications operator should be able to tell you more about the connection to this service.
Sabbatical planners have the opportunity to learn while travelling, and more and more of them choose this option.
This formula is particularly popular among young people who drop out of school, because it allows them to take a year off before university, without compromising their studies.
Often, taking a year off to study abroad can actually give you better chances of going on to study at university in your country.
Generally, you have to pay tuition fees to take these educational programmes.
Finland is a popular destination for sailing. The "Land of the thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, in lakes and in coastal archipelagos.
You do not necessarily need a yacht in the archipelago and on the lake.
Although the coastal islands and the largest lakes are actually quite large for a boat, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Recreational boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden and New Zealand are in the same situation, but apart from that, it is a unique case (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one to 40).
Most cruises on the Baltic Sea are characterised by a prolonged stay in St Petersburg, in Russia.
That means you can visit the historic city for several days and return to sleep on the boat at night.
If you do not land on the ground with cruises, you will not need a separate visa (from 2009).
The city of Berlin, in Germany, is mentioned in some cruise brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not at all located near the sea and no visit to this city is included in the cruise price. 
Travelling by air can be a terrifying experience for all ages and from all walks of life, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
Don't be ashamed of it: it's not different from the fears and fears that many people have about other things.
For some, understanding something about how aircraft work and what happens during a flight can help to overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or on the fact that you do not have control.
The companies that transport goods are well paid to deliver fast. Often, in an urgent repair, the question of time is crucial for documents, goods or spare parts that relate to them.
On some roads, large companies have their own aircraft, but on other roads and for small businesses, there has been a problem.
If they had shipped goods by air freight, on some routes, it would have taken days to clear customs and to get the goods to the destination.
The only way to do this faster was to send it as registered baggage. Airline regulations will not allow them to send a bag without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The easiest way to travel first class or business class is to pay a large sum of money for this privilege (or, better still, ask your company to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: generally, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal business fare and up to eleven times for first class!
Generally, it is pointless to try to get discounts for business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that they can count on a certain type of passenger who are willing to pay very high prices for the privileges of speed and comfort, and they set their prices in good faith.
The capital of the Republic of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is very common.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic state that is suffering from ethnic conflicts.
The conflict in Transnistria in 1994 led to the creation of the proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, with its own government and its own currency, but recognized by no member of the United Nations.
The economic links between these two parts of Moldova have been restored despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
With a population of 3.7 million, İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey, the second port after Istanbul, and a good platform for correspondence.
What was once the ancient city of Smyrna is today a modern commercial centre, developed and living, located around an immense bay, surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, the glass buildings and modern shopping centres are dotted with traditional red tiled roofs, the old market of the 17th century, and old mosques and churches, although the city has a Mediterranean atmosphere reminiscent of Turkey rather than traditional Turkey.
Haldarsvík is a small village on the island of Eysturoy and it has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, there are interesting marble sculptures depicting doves on some graves.
It is worth walking around this fascinating village for half an hour.
The romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, located north, is easily accessible and has been made famous to foreigners by the vivid account of its splendour that Lord Byron made of it.
The bus 403 of Scotturb travels regularly to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
Going north, do not miss out on visiting the beautiful Fatima shrine (temple), a world-famous place for the appearances of Mary.
Don't forget that you are visiting primarily a mass grave, as well as a site that has a very significant meaning for a large part of the world's population.
There are still many women and men alive who have survived their stay here, and many others who have seen their loved ones killed or killed by forced labour, Jews or non-Jews, regardless of their race.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Don't make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Don't spoil the site by painting or scratching graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the residents prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and almost everyone is able to speak Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, because the law establishes that it is the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan, but unforeseen disruptions are announced by an automated system in many languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
The Parisians have the reputation of being egocentric, rude and arrogant.
Although this stereotype is often inaccurate, the best way to get along in Paris is to behave well, act like someone of good manners. This will make your travels much easier.
The abrupt exteriors of Parisians disappear quickly if you show a modicum of courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely wooded, mainly of firs, pine and oaks, and features a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
The country has a great variety of plant communities because of the diversity of its microclimates, soils and altitudes.
The region also contains a very large variety of animals and birds.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the owl, the lynx, the wild cat, and the great tit can be seen there, as well as many common species.
When they visit a monastery, women must cover their knees and cover their shoulders as well.
Most monasteries provide shawls to women who arrive without anything, but if you bring your own shawl, and if it is also brightly coloured, you will get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
As well as men should wear trousers covering the knees.
You can also borrow this dress from the stockroom, but as it is not washed after each use, it is possible that you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. A one-size-fits-all for men!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar regions in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (mainly pork), and relies on olive oil.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato and all the available condiments, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
Every name, followed by the word Sie which means you, begins always with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
It is a good way of distinguishing between some verbs and objects.
It can also be said that it facilitates reading, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to know whether a verb or an adjective is used as a substantive.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written
The most important letters to watch are the c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Please also ensure that you pronounce 'r' and 'rr' distinctly: 'caro' means 'dear', while 'carro' means 'cart'.
Persian has a relatively easy grammar and most of the time regular.
Therefore, reading this introduction to Persian grammar would help you to learn a great deal about Persian grammar and better understand the phrases.
It is of course a given that if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, those who speak a little Spanish might conclude prematurely that Portuguese is sufficiently close to Spanish to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are generally obsolete today, and remain as museums or educational sites.
As light pollution at the time was not as serious as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campus, easier to access than those built in the modern era.
Modern astronomical observatories are enormous infrastructures placed in remote regions where the weather conditions are favourable.
Hanami, the Japanese tradition of viewing cherry blossoms, is a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where plum blossoms were the favourite flower.
In Japan, the first Cherry Blossom Festivals were held by the Emperor only for himself and his close circle of courtiers around the Imperial Palace.
Plants are their most beautiful when they are in a natural environment, resist the temptation to take just one.
If you visit a strictly-designed garden, the collection of'specimens' will also make you leave without discussion.
Singapore is generally regarded as an extremely safe place, where it is very easy to move, and where you can buy almost everything you need once you arrive there.
But, located in the "high latitudes", only a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to adapt to the heat (always) and to strong solar radiation (when the sky is clear, which is rarer).
There are also some buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Check that the bus you are thinking of taking will take you to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kyriat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme for holidays.
For example, visit castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or take a cruise along the Erie Canal.
They also define the routes for popular cycling and walking trails.
Christmas is one of the most important Christian festivals, it celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Many traditions associated with these festivals have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians in the world.
It is customary to spend Easter night awake in a place exposed to the sun to see the sunrise.
There are certainly Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian spring ritual and fertility ritual.
Traditional churches often hold a midnight Easter vigil on the Saturday night during Easter week, the congregations often breaking into the celebration at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All animals that have arrived on these islands have done so by water, by swimming or by air.
Because of the great distance between the islands, mammals have not been able to complete their journey, making the giant tortoise the main animal of pasture on the Galapagos Islands.
From the arrival of man to the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including cattle, horses, cows, rabbits, cats and dogs.
If you visit the arctic or antarctic regions in winter, you will be able to see the polar night, during which the sun does not rise above the horizon.
It is a good opportunity to admire the northern lights, as the sky will be dark practically all day.
As regions are sparsely populated, and that light pollution is not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than that which Westerners can be accustomed to.
Costumes are classic workwear, and employees are referred to by their family name or by their job title.
Working together is crucial, because it emphasises the collective effort rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers must often obtain the agreement of their superiors for any decision they take and are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without asking questions.
